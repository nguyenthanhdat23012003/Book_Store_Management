        "description": "By the author of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. A fascinating \u201ccoming of age\u201d tale, complete with switched identities, national security, danger, and intrigue. Set in London during the bloody reign of King Henry VIII, it tells the story of two young boys who are identical in appearance: Tom Canty, a pauper who lives with his abusive father in Offal Court off Pudding Lane in London, and Prince Edward. Through a series of unpredictable events, these boys from different worlds meet and playfully dress in each other\u2019s clothing\u2014surprised to see themselves in a mirror and realize that they could easily be mistaken for the other. The real prince, dressed as the poor boy, is thrown into the street, but not before he hides the Great Seal of England in his clothing. What follows is a tale full of pathos, danger, and plot twists during which the authority of the king is threatened and the two boys are forced to adapt to the foreign world of the other. Though this is a classic of historical fiction, the famous Mark Twain spins a thriller that is both entertaining and relatable to modern readers. This book has been adapted into several major motion pictures beginning with the 1937 version starring Errol Flynn.

The pieces range in time from antiquity (Homer, Ovid) through early modern and Enlightenment Europe (Ariosto, Defoe, Diderot, Voltaire) to the masters of the nineteenth-century novel, before dealing with Calvino's early American mentors (Twain, James, Hemingway) and contemporaries such as Borges, Pasternak and Queneau. They also offer the most comprehensive sample available of Calvino the literary critic in substantial articles which he wrote over a period of 30 years from the 1950s to his death in 1985. WHY READ THE CLASSICS sheds fascinating light on the key texts which influenced, and proves that as well as being the internationally renowned fiction writer, Calvino ranks among the most interesting essayists and critics of the twentieth century..",

Engaging with the diversity of tones, forms and styles that fantasy can take in the cinema, the book examines the value and significance of fantasy across a wide range of key films. This volume extends critical understanding beyond the often narrowly defined boundaries of what is seen as \"fantasy\". Fantasy Film uses key concepts in film studies - such as authorship, representation, history,genre, coherence and point of view - to interrogate the fantasy genre and establish its parameters. A wide range of films are held up to close scrutiny to illustrate the discussion. Moving from Alfred Hitchcock's dark thrillers to Vincente Minnelli's vibrant musicals, from George M\u00e9li\u00e8s' 1904 Voyage \u00e0 travers l'impossible to the X-Men series, the creative dexterity and excitement of film fantasy is evoked and explored. The book will be invaluable to students and fans of the fantasy genre.",

        "description": "Written by leading design philosopher Tony Fry, Writing Design Fiction: Relocating a City in Crisis is both an introduction to the power of \u201cdesign fiction\u201d in the design process, and a novella-length work of fiction in itself-telling the dramatic story of the relocation of the City of Harshon. Set in the near future, Harshon, a delta city, is facing environmental catastrophe due to rising sea levels-consequently, a decision is made to relocate the entire city inland. A diverse cast of voices-including an architect, a journalist, an economist, a construction worker, and residents-narrate the extraordinary challenges and complexities which follow. This work presents a real-world scenario which, in coming decades, will face many of the world's cities. The fictional format provides a novel way of exploring the very serious inherent technical, social, political, economic and cultural challenges. The story provides a rehearsal of the design challenges which are likely to face architects, planners, and designers in an uncertain global future. \u201cDesign fiction\u201d is a fast-growing area within design and architecture, increasingly deployed as a serious methodology by designers as a tool in scenario planning. Writing Design Fiction takes the practice to a higher level conceptually and theoretically, but also practically. The book is divided into four parts, with the fictional narrative bookended by further critical analysis. Part One shows how a critique of existing modes of design fiction can lead to more grounded and critical thinking and practice. Part Three critically reflects on the narrative, while Part Four presents the practical application of the second order design fiction approach. This book demonstrates the value of a more developed mode of design fiction to students, professional designers and architects across the breadth of design practices, as well as to other disciplines interested in the future of cities.",

Because science fiction is part of Latin American popular culture, it reflects cultural and social concerns and comments on contemporary society. While there is a growing body of criticism on Latin American science fiction, most studies treat only a single author or work. This reference offers a broad overview of Latin American science fiction. Included are alphabetically arranged entries on 70 Latin American science fiction writers. While some of these are canonical figures, others have been largely neglected. Since much of science fiction has been written by women, many women writers are profiled. Each entry is prepared by an expert contributor and includes a short biography, a discussion of the writer's works, and primary and secondary bibliographies. The volume closes with a general bibliography of anthologies and criticism.",

Aware of the prospect of ecological collapse as well as our apparent inability to avert it, we face geophysical changes of drastic proportions that severely challenge our ability to imagine the consequences. This book argues that this crisis of imagination can be partly relieved by climate fiction, which may help us comprehend the potential impact of the crisis we are facing. Strictly assigning \"climate fiction\" to fictions that incorporate the climatological paradigm of anthropogenic global warming into their plots, this book sets out to salvage the term\u2019s speculative quality. It argues that climate fiction should be regarded as no less than a vital supplement to climate science, because climate fiction makes visible and conceivable future modes of existence within worlds not only deemed likely by science, but which are scientifically anticipated. Focusing primarily on English and German language fictions, Climate Fiction and Cultural Analysis shows how Western climate fiction sketches various affective and cognitive relations to the world in its utilization of a small number of recurring imaginaries, or imagination forms. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of ecocriticism, the environmental humanities, and literary and culture studies more generally.",

The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles's nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society.",

        "description": "Horror cinema is a hugely successful, but at the same time culturally illicit genre that spans the history of cinema. It continues to flourish with recent cycles of supernatural horror and torture porn that span the full range of horror styles and aesthetics. It is enjoyed by audiences everywhere, but also seen as a malign influence by others. In this Routledge Film Guidebook, audience researcher and film scholar Brigid Cherry provides a comprehensive overview of the horror film and explores how the genre works. Examining the way horror films create images of gore and the uncanny through film technology and effects, Cherry provides an account of the way cinematic and stylistic devices create responses of terror and disgust in the viewer. Horror examines the way these films construct psychological and cognitive responses and how they speak to audiences on an intimate personal level, addressing their innermost fears and desires. Cherry further explores the role of horror cinema in society and culture, looking at how it represents various identity groups and engages with social anxieties, and examining the way horror sees, and is seen by, society.",

The book focuses on recent postmodern examples such as The Blair Witch Project. In a daring move, the volume also examines Holocaust films in relation to horror. Part One features essays on the silent and classical Hollywood eras. Part Two covers the postWorld War II era and discusses the historical, aesthetic, and psychological characteristics of contemporary horror films. In contrast to horror during the classical Hollywood period, contemporary horror features more graphic and prolonged visualizations of disturbing and horrific imagery, as well as other distinguishing characteristics. Princes introduction provides an overview of the genre, contextualizing the readings that follow. Stephen Prince is professor of communications at Virginia Tech. He has written many film books, including Classical Film Violence: Designing and Regulating Brutality in Hollywood Cinema, 19301968, and has edited Screening Violence, also in the Depth of Field Series.",

Lovecraft proclaimed his Dunwich Horror \"so fiendish\" that his editor at Weird Tales \"may not dare to print it.\" The editor, fortunately, knew a good thing when he saw it. One of the core Cthulhu stories, The Dunwich Horror introduces us to the grim village of Dunwich, where each member of the Whateley family is more grotesque than the other. There's the grandfather, a mad old sorcerer; Lavinia, the deformed, albino woman; and Wilbur, a disgusting specimen who reaches full manhood in less than a decade. And above all, there's the mysterious presence in the farmhouse, unseen but horrifying, which seems to be growing . . . Wilbur tracks down an original edition of the Necronomicon and breaks into a library to steal it. But his reward eludes him: he gets caught, and the result is death by guard dog. Meanwhile, left unattended, the monster at the Whateley house keeps expanding, until the farmhouse explodes and the beast is unleashed to terrorize the poor, aggrieved village of Dunwich. As chilling today as it was upon its publication in 1929, The Dunwich Horror is a horrifying masterwork by the man Stephen King called \"the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.\"",

        "description": "The Horror Film is an in-depth exploration of one of the most consistently popular, but also most disreputable, of all the mainstream film genres. Since the early 1930s there has never been a time when horror films were not being produced in substantial numbers somewhere in the world and never a time when they were not being criticised, censored or banned. The Horror Film engages with the key issues raised by this most contentious of genres. It considers the reasons for horror's disreputability and seeks to explain why despite this horror has been so successful. Where precisely does the appeal of horror lie? An extended introductory chapter identifies what it is about horror that makes the genre so difficult to define. The chapter then maps out the historical development of the horror genre, paying particular attention to the international breadth and variety of horror production, with reference to films made in the United States, Britain, Italy, Spain and elsewhere. Subsequent chapters explore: The role of monsters, focusing on the vampire and the serial killer. The usefulness (and limitations) of psychological approaches to horror. The horror audience: what kind of people like horror (and what do other people think of them)? Gender, race and class in horror: how do horror films such as Bride of Frankenstein, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Blade relate to the social and political realities within which they are produced? Sound and horror: in what ways has sound contributed to the development of horror? Performance in horror: how have performers conveyed fear and terror throughout horror's history? 1970s horror: was this the golden age of horror production? Slashers and post-slashers: from Halloween to Scream and beyond. The Horror Film throws new light on some well-known horror films but also introduces the reader to examples of noteworthy but more obscure horror work. A final section provides a guide to further reading and an extensive bibliography. Accessibly written, The Horror Film is a lively and informative account of the genre that will appeal to students of cinema, film teachers and researchers, and horror lovers everywhere.",

        "description": "Explores the concept of \u0093moral horror\u0094 as the experience of living amidst unjustifiable state violence. Can state violence ever be morally justified? In State Violence and Moral Horror, Jeremy Arnold critically engages a wide variety of arguments, both canonical and contemporary, arguing that there can be no justification. Drawing on the concept of singularity found in the work of French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, Arnold demonstrates that any attempt to justify state violence will itself be violent and, therefore, must fail as a justification. On the basis of this argument, the book explores the concept of \u0093moral horror\u0094 as the experience of living amidst and acquiescing to unjustifiable state violence. The careful explanation of arguments from across the spectrum of political theory and exceptionally clear prose will enable both advanced undergraduates and more general readers interested in political thought to understand and engage the central argument. State Violence and Moral Horror is a unique contribution to the growing literature on violence and will be of interest to political theorists and philosophers in both the analytic and continental traditions, philosophers of law, international relations theorists, law and society scholars, and social scientists interested in normative aspects of state violence.",

        "description": "During the past century, an enormous effervescence of events changed the sociopolitical configuration of the world. The interpretation of these facts helped further deepen the crisis in which modern thought already found itself--and it generated the uncertain and unstable environment in which we live today, the so-called postmodernity, late modernity, or hypermodernity. In this context, one of the most profound impacts is most certainly the one on religion. During the twentieth century, religion proved not to be banished from the human horizon as the masters of suspicion intended. Known as the godless century, the twentieth century saw also a resuscitation of the search for the sense of life and spirituality. With the crisis of modern reason, humankind turned toward consumerism and provisional and \"light\" practices. The last century represents not only the height of the postmodernization process but also the rescue of the transcendent and absolute, even if it is an absolute without face and identity. It is in this scenario that religious experiences, apparently exiled by modern rationality, begin to occur and multiply again. Mystical experiences will be, then, the basis for highlighting recurrent characteristics with universal import. But they will show a different configuration than before. One will be able to find them not in so-called sacred spaces but in very secular ones; not so much within institutions but at the borders, or even outside them; not configured by a specific tradition but in an interface that makes more than one tradition meet and dialogue.",

In his engaging style, Hart guides readers toward a deeper understanding of the Mass\u2014its roots in the Jewish Sabbath, its sacrificial character, and its signs and symbols.

Since its inception in the eighties of the last century, the local initiative has developed into the major European discussion forum for research focussing on the contribution of (one of the) Romance languages to general linguistic theorizing as well as on the working out of in-depth analyses of Romance data within linguistic frameworks. The annual meeting took place on December, 8-10.The present volume is the 5th of the series Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory published by John Benjamins. We publish here a selected set of peer-reviewed articles bearing on topics in phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, that represent both issues of theoretical nature as well as developments in the field of acquisition. The articles are of great interest for specialists of Romance and for general linguists appreciating parameters and/or language acquisition. Among the contributions are three papers presented by invited speakers (Andrea Calabrese, Ricardo Etxepare and Jason Rothman), while two other very prominent Romance linguists figure as co-authors (Aafke Hulk, Luigi Rizzi).",

        "description": "With a career that spanned from the silent era to the 1990s, British screenwriter Charles Bennett (1899--1995) lived an extraordinary life. His experiences as an actor, director, playwright, film and television writer, and novelist in both England and Hollywood left him with many amusing anecdotes, opinions about his craft, and impressions of the many famous people he knew. Among other things, Bennett was a decorated WWI hero, an eminent Shakespearean actor, and an Allied spy and propagandist during WWII, but he is best remembered for his commercially and critically acclaimed collaborations with directors Sir Alfred Hitchcock and Cecil B. DeMille. The fruitful partnership began after Hitchcock adapted Bennett's play Blackmail (1929) as the first British sound film. Their partnership produced six thrillers: The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), The 39 Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), Secret Agent (1936), Young and Innocent (1937), and Foreign Correspondent (1940). In this witty and intriguing book, Bennett discusses how their collaboration created such famous motifs as the \"wrong man accused\" device and the MacGuffin. He also takes readers behind the scenes with the Master of Suspense, offering his thoughts on the director's work, sense of humor, and personal life. Featuring an introduction and additional biographical material from Bennett's son, editor John Charles Bennett, Hitchcock's Partner in Suspense is a richly detailed narrative of a remarkable yet often-overlooked figure in film history.",

He has since been one of the most consistent international best-selling authors, with approximately 130 million copies of his books sold worldwide. His manifold influences on the thriller genre includes the pioneering use of strong female characters in espionage stories and the development of the historical thriller as a new form of novel, exemplified by Winter of the World (2012). This book is an investigation of Follett\u2019s development as an author, and of the craft of writing and the negotiation of serious versus popular literary value, from his earliest short stories and screenplays through his mature thrillers and entertainment fiction. Unpublished materials are also considered, including his notes, business and personal correspondence, unpublished drafts, journal entries and outlines. Follett\u2019s dramatic shift to writing historical fiction may be his most enduring legacy.",

        "description": "Alfred Hitchcock had a gift for turning the familiar into the unfamiliar, the mundane into the unexpected. A director known for planning the entire movie before the first day of filming began by using the storyboard approach, Hitchcock was renowned for his relaxed directing style, resulting in an excellent rapport with his actors. Decades later, Hitchcock\u2019s films stand as sterling examples of innovative technique, infused with meaning that only repeated viewing can reveal. This work examines themes, techniques, and the filmmaking process in 15 of Hitchcock\u2019s best known films: The 39 Steps, Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, Notorious, Rope, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, The Birds, Frenzy and Family Plot. It explores the auteur\u2019s treatments of psychoanalysis, voyeurism, and collective fears during the Cold War. Also presented are key stories behind several Hitchcock classics, such as the director\u2019s stormy relationships with Raymond Chandler and David O. Selznick that resulted in synergetic success for some of his most successful films. The book includes numerous photographs and an extensive bibliography.",

        "description": "Julie Andrews is the last of the great Hollywood musical stars, unequaled by any in her time. In My Fair Lady, Julie Andrews had the biggest hit on Broadway. As the title character in Mary Poppins, she won an Academy Award. And, in 1965, The Sound of Music made her the most famous woman in the world and rescued Twentieth Century Fox from bankruptcy. Three years later, the disastrous Star! almost put the studio back under, and the leading lady of both films fell as spectacularly as she had risen. Her film career seemed over. Yet Julie Andrews survived, with what Moss Hart, director of My Fair Lady, called \"that terrible British strength that makes you wonder why they lost India.\" Victor/Victoria, directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards, reinvented her screen image---but its stage version in 1997 led to the devastating loss of her defining talent, her singing voice. Against all odds, she has fought back again, with leading roles in The Princess Diaries and Shrek 2. The real story of bandy-legged little Julia Wells from Walton-on-Thames is even more extraordinary; fresh details of her family background have only recently come to light. This is the first completely new biography of Julie Andrews as artist, wife, and mother in over thirty-five years---combining the author's interviews with the star and his wide-ranging and riveting research. It is a frank but affectionate portrait of an enduring icon of stage and screen, who was made a Dame in the Millenium Honours List. Once dubbed \"the last of the really great broads\" by Paul Newman, she was the only actress in the 2002 BBC poll The 100 Greatest Britons. But who was Dame Julie, and who is she now? This is her story.",

There are many specialized books on Kennedy's career, but no first-class modern biography--one that takes advantage of the huge volume of recent books and articles and new material released by the JFK library. Ten years in the making, this is a balanced and judicious profile that goes beyond the clash of interpretations and offers a fresh, nuanced perspective.",

Acclaimed by the critics-and a best seller- in its original version, it has now been brought up to the present, and beautifully illustrated with one hundred thirty-two memorable photographs. The result: an even more fascinating study of one of the screen's true immortals. In a period spanning less than two decades, from 1925 to 1941, this shy, working-class girl from Stockholm, the possessor of the face of the century, made twenty-four films, and became the most famous actress in the world. She also became one of its great ornaments and excitements and objects of wonder-\"the unapproachable goddess,\" said Alistair Cooke, \"of the most widespread and remarkable mythology in human history.\" As a consequence, she found herself the victim of more fatuous and hysterical journalism than any other personality on earth. Mercilessly hounded by the public and press at every turn, she developed an intense aversion to publicity that contributed to making the world's most beautiful woman into one of its loneliest. \"I never said, 'I want to be alone, '\" Garbo told a friend. \"I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference.\" With sensitivity, wit, and understanding, Mr Bainbridge presents the whole fabulous story from its unlikely beginning through her last picture and into her retirement, which, ironically, Garbo never planned to make permanent. Her life today-her friends, her interests, her haunts-brings this absorbing biography up to the present moment. An appendix, \"The Films of Greta Garbo,\" lists all of her pictures, both European and American, their casts, production credits, and the place and date of the premiere of each--Page 2 and 3 of cover",

Use it to make your \u201990s-themed gatherings even more legit, or for meal ideas anytime you\u2019re feeling a little clueless. Witty, charming, privileged Cher Horowitz leads the pack at her Beverly Hills high school in Amy Heckerling\u2019s cult classic Clueless. Through the eyes of style-obsessed Cher, we join in the fun of makeovers, the rollercoaster ride of crushes and friendships, and the social hierarchy of high school. Inspired by the snacks, drinks, and meals highlighted throughout the film, the Southern California healthy eating craze, and the best of the 1990s, the recipes in this official cookbook are tribute to the adventures and calamities of Cher, Dionne, Tai, Murray, Josh, Travis, and all the rest of our favorite Clueless characters. From take-it-with-you options like Gnarly Skateboarder\u2019s Breakfast Sandos to homemade versions of snack foods that litter the lunch tables at Cher\u2019s school (Off-the-Diet Popcorn, anyone?), the recipes in this cookbook bring the personalities and narrative of Clueless to life.

        "description": "Named one of New York Times Top-20 Cookbooks of 2006. Have you ever wanted to host a full evening of Indian food, culture, and music? How about preparing a traditional Balinese banquet? Or take a trip to Cairo and enjoy an Egyptian feast? The Ethnomusicologists' Cookbook takes you around the world on a culinary journey that is also a cultural and social odyssey. Many cookbooks offer a snapshot of individual recipes from different parts of the world, but do nothing to tell the reader how different foods are presented together, or how to relate these foods to other cultural practices. For years, ethnomusicologists have visited the four corners of the earth to collect the music and culture of native peoples, from Africa to the Azores, from Zanzibar to New Zealand. Along the way, they've observed how music is an integral part of social interaction, particularly when it's time for a lavish banquet or celebration. Foodways and cultural expression are not separate; this book emphasizes this connection through offering over thirty-five complete meals, from appetizers to entrees to side dishes to desserts and drinks. A list of recommended CDs fills out the culinary experience, along with hints on how to present each dish and to organize the overall meal. The Ethnomusicologists' Cookbook combines scholarship with a unique and fun approach to the study of the world's foods, musics, and cultures. More than just a cookbook, it is an excellent companion for anyone embarking on a cultural-culinary journey.",

        "description": "In the third Quarterly Essay for 2006, Inga Clendinnen looks past the skirmishes and pitched battles of the history wars and asks what's at stake - what kind of history do we want and need? Should our historians be producing the ''''''''objective record of achievement'''''''' that the Prime Minister has called for? For Clendinnen, historians cannot be the midwives of national identity and also be true to their profession: history cannot do the work of myth. Clendinnen illuminates the ways in which history, myth and fiction differ from one another, and why the differences are important. In discussing what good history looks like, she pays tribute to the human need for story telling but notes the distinctive critical role of the historian. She offers a spirited critique of Kate Grenville's novel The Secret River, and discusses the Stolen Generations and the role of morality in history writing. This is an eloquent and stimulating essay about a subject that has generated much heat in recent times: how we should record and regard the nation's past. ''''''''Who owns the past? In a free society, everyone. It is a magic pudding belonging to anyone who wants to cut themselves a slice, from legend manufacturers through novelists looking for ready - made plots, to interest groups out to extend their influence.'''''''' - Inga Clendinnen, The History Question.",

        "description": "The essay\u2014with its emphasis on the provisional and explorative rather than on definitive statements\u2014has evolved from its literary beginnings and is now found in all mediums, including film. Today, the essay film is, arguably, one of the most widely acclaimed and critically discussed forms of filmmaking around the world, with practitioners such as Chris Marker, Hito Steyerl, Errol Morris, Trinh T. Minh-ha, and Rithy Panh. Characteristics of the essay film include the blending of fact and fiction, the mixing of art- and documentary-film styles, the foregrounding of subjective points of view, a concentration on public life, a tension between acoustic and visual discourses, and a dialogic encounter with audiences. This anthology of fundamental statements on the essay film offers a range of crucial historical and philosophical perspectives. It provides early critical articulations of the essay film as it evolved through the 1950s and 1960s, key contemporary scholarly essays, and a selection of writings by essay filmmakers. It features texts on the foundations of the essay film by writers such as Hans Richter and Andr\u00e9 Bazin; contemporary positions by, among others, Phillip Lopate and Michael Renov; and original essays by filmmakers themselves, including Laura Mulvey and Isaac Julien.",

        "description": "In A Poet\u2019s Guide to Poetry, Mary Kinzie brings her decades of expertise as poet, critic, and director of the creative writing program at Northwestern University to bear in a comprehensive reference work for any writer wishing to better understand poetry. Detailing the formal concepts of poetry and methods of poetic analysis, she shows how the craft of writing can guide the art of reading poems. Using examples from the major traditions of lyric and meditative poetry in English from the medieval period to the present, Kinzie considers the sounds and rhythms of poetry along with the ideas and thought-units within poems. Kinzie also shares her own successful classroom tactics that encourage readers to approach a poem as if it were provisional. The three parts of A Poet\u2019s Guide to Poetry lead the reader through a carefully planned introduction to the ways we understand poetry. The first section provides careful, step-by-step instruction to familiarize students with the formal elements of poems, from the most obvious feature through the most subtle. The second part carefully examines meter and rhythm, as well as providing a theoretical and practical overview of free verse. The final section offers helpful chapters on writing in form. Rounding out the volume are writing exercises for beginning and advanced writers, a dictionary of poetic terms, and a bibliography of further reading. For this new edition, Kinzie has carefully reworked the introductory material and first chapter, as well as amended the annotated bibliography to include the most recent works of criticism. The updated guide also contains revised exercises and adjustments throughout the text to make the work as lucid and accessible as possible.",

He isolates certain persistent ideas about poetry's situation relative to life and focuses on the conflict the poet faces between the nature of words and poetic forms on one side, and the nature of experience on the other. The author ranges for his often surprising examples from Keats to the great modernists such as Stevens and Williams, to the contents of recent magazines. He considers work by Ammons, Ashbery, Bogan, Ginsberg, Lowell, Merwin, O'Hara, and younger writers, offering judgments and enthusiasms from a viewpoint that is consistent but unstereotyped. Like his poetry, Robert Pinsky's criticism joins the traditional and the innovative in ways that are thoughtful and unmistakably his own. His book is a bold essay on the contemporary situation in poetry, on the dazzling achievements of modernism, and on the nature or \"situation\" of poetry itself.",

        "description": "This volume provides an in-depth comparative study of translation practices and the role of the poet-translator across different countries and in so doing, demonstrates the need for poetry translation to be extended beyond close reading and situated in context. Drawing on a corpus composed of data from national library catalogues and Worldcat, the book examines translation practices of English-language, French-language, and Italian-language poet-translators through the lens of a broad sociological approach. Chapters 2 through 5 look at national poetic movements, literary markets, and the historical and socio-political contexts of translations, with Chapter 6 offering case studies of prominent and representative poet-translators from each tradition. A comprehensive set of appendices offers readers an opportunity to explore this data in greater detail. Taken together, the volume advocates for the need to study translation data against broader aesthetic, historical, and political trends and will be of particular interest to students and scholars in translation studies and comparative literature.",

The contributors to Art and the Academy in the Nineteenth Century challenge this entrenched notion and consider how academies worldwide have represented an important system of artistic preservation and transmission. Their essays eschew easy binaries that have reigned in academia for more than half a century and that simply oppose the avant-garde to academicism.",

Many of the authors address topics that Ziff has discussed in his writings: understanding, rules and regularities, proper names, the feelings of machines, expression, and aesthetic experience. Paul Ziff began his professional career as an artist, went on to study painting with J. M. Hanson at Cornell, and then studied for the Ph. D. in philosophy, also at Cornell, with Max Black. Over the next three decades he produced a series of remarkable papers in philosophy of art, culminating in 1984 with the publica tion of Antiaesthetics: An Appreciation of the Cow with the Subtile Nose. In 1960 he published Semantic Analysis, his masterwork in philosophy of lan guage. Throughout his career he made important contributions to philosophy of mind in such papers as \"The Simplicity of Other Minds\" (1965) and \"About Behaviourism\" (1958). In addition to his work in these areas, his lec tures at Harvard on philosophy of religion are an underground classic; and throughout his career he has continued to make art and to search for the meaning of life in the properties of prime numbers. Although his interests are wide and deep, questions about language, art, and mind have dominated his philosophical work, and it is problems in these areas that provide the topics of most of the essays in this volume.",

Jones discusses the strengths and limitations of Websites; scholarly and basic information resources are noted; and search strategies for finding pertinent Websites are included. Art Information and the Internet also discusses research methodology for studying art-historical styles, artists working in various media, individual works of art, and non-Western cultures--as well as art education, writing about art, problems of copyright, and issues concerning the buying and selling of art.

It thoroughly examines how to categorise the material culture of tourism within the discourses of contemporary art and cultural anthropology, and demonstrates that tourist art is a unique expression of place and genuine artistic style. The first investigation to consider the activity of souvenirs from both indigenous and settler tourist sites, it brings a unique addition to the existing, dated, research in the area. Working initially from Graburn\u2019s definition of tourist art, as the art of one culture made specifically for the consumption of another, Tourism Art and Souvenirs sheds light on important aspects of the souvenir that have not been widely discussed. The most recent research is used to consider how the souvenir is designed and consumed, consumer expectations and influence on the character of the souvenir, how the souvenir maker is consumed by the tradition of heritage and how products become successful as souvenirs. The title also investigates the language involved in the representation of place and the recording of experience through the souvenir, developing a method that expresses the descriptive data of individual souvenir artefacts graphically so the patterns of language may be analysed. Enhancing the understanding of material culture in tourism and therefore adding to future tourism development this volume will be of interest to upper level students, researchers and academics in tourism, culture, heritage and sustainability.",

By reproducing Deleuze's social and intellectual references, Sauvagnargues is able to construct a precise map of the totality of Deleuze's work, pinpointing where key Deleuzian concepts first emerge and eventually disappear. This innovative methodology, which Sauvagnargues calls \"periodization\", provides a systematic historiography of Deleuze's philosophy that remains faithful to his affirmation of the principle of exteriority. By analyzing the external relations between Deleuze's self-proclaimed three philosophical periods, Sauvagnargues gives the reader an inside look into the conceptual and artistic landscape that surrounded Deleuze and the creation of his philosophy. With extreme clarity and precision, Sauvagnargues provides an important glimpse into Deleuze's philosophy by reconstructing the social and intellectual contexts that contributed to the trajectory of his thought. This book is the product of insightful and careful research, which has not been made available to English readers of Deleuze before now.",

The aims of this part are twofold: to provide the beginner with an overview of the terminology and concepts of computer graphics, based on GKS, and to give the computer graphics expert an introduc tion to the GKS standard. In the early chapters of this part, the main areas of computer graphics, the various classes of com puter graphics users, the interfaces of GKS and its underlying design concepts are discussed and important terms are defined. The later chapters give an informal introduction to the main concepts of GKS and their interrelationships: output, attributes, coordinate systems, transformations, input, segments, metafile, state lists, and error handling. This introduction to the GKS framework will prepare the ground for the detailed description of 2D GKS functions in Part III and the 3D extensions to GKS in Part IV. 1 WHAT IS COMPUTER GRAPHICS? 1. 1 Defmition of Computer Graphics The Data Processing Vocabulary of the International Organization for Stan dardization (ISO) [ISO 84] defines Computer Graphics as follows: \"Methods and techniques for converting data to and from a graphic display via computer. \" This definition refers to three basic components of any computer graphics system - namely \"data\", \"computer\", and \"display\".",

It addresses the ongoing issues related to computer hardware and discusses the solutions supplied by the industry. The book describes trends in computing solutions that led to the current available infrastructures, tracing the initial need for computers to recent concepts such as the Internet of Things. It covers computers\u2019 data representation, explains how computer architecture and its underlying meaning changed over the years, and examines the implementations and performance enhancements of the central processing unit (CPU). It then discusses the organization, hierarchy, and performance considerations of computer memory as applied by the operating system and illustrates how cache memory significantly improves performance. The author proceeds to explore the bus system, algorithms for ensuring data integrity, input and output (I/O) components, methods for performing I/O, various aspects relevant to software engineering, and nonvolatile storage devices, such as hard drives and technologies for enhancing performance and reliability. He also describes virtualization and cloud computing and the emergence of software-based systems\u2019 architectures. Accessible to software engineers and developers as well as students in IT disciplines, this book enhances readers\u2019 understanding of the hardware infrastructure used in software engineering projects. It enables readers to better optimize system usage by focusing on the principles used in hardware systems design and the methods for enhancing performance.",

        "description": "Not only does almost everyone in the civilized world use a personal computer, smartphone, and/or tablet on a daily basis to communicate with others and access information, but virtually every other modern appliance, vehicle, or other device has one or more computers embedded inside it. One cannot purchase a current-model automobile, for example, without several computers on board to do everything from monitoring exhaust emissions, to operating the anti-lock brakes, to telling the transmission when to shift, and so on. Appliances such as clothes washers and dryers, microwave ovens, refrigerators, etc. are almost all digitally controlled. Gaming consoles like Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii are powerful computer systems with enhanced capabilities for user interaction. Computers are everywhere, even when we don\u2019t see them as such, and it is more important than ever for students who will soon enter the workforce to understand how they work. This book is completely updated and revised for a one-semester upper level undergraduate course in Computer Architecture, and suitable for use in an undergraduate CS, EE, or CE curriculum at the junior or senior level. Students should have had a course(s) covering introductory topics in digital logic and computer organization. While this is not a text for a programming course, the reader should be familiar with computer programming concepts in at least one language such as C, C++, or Java. Previous courses in operating systems, assembly language, and/or systems programming would be helpful, but are not essential.",

BCI systems can be divided into two groups according to the placement of the electrodes used to detect and measure neurons firing in the brain. These groups are: invasive systems, electrodes are inserted directly into the cortex are used for single cell or multi unit recording, and electrocorticography (EcoG), electrodes are placed on the surface of the cortex (or dura); noninvasive systems, they are placed on the scalp and use electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) to detect neuron activity. The book is basically divided into three parts. The first part of the book covers the basic concepts and overviews of Brain Computer Interface. The second part describes new theoretical developments of BCI systems. The third part covers views on real applications of BCI systems.",

        "description": "What exactly is education policy, why is it important, and how is it implemented in the real world? Jerome Delaney, a professor of educational administration and former high school principal, answers the big questions about education policy in this powerful and practical primer for students. Informed by his experience in the public school system, Delaney takes a pragmatic and realistic approach that divides a complicated subject into manageable sub-topics. He grounds the debate at the classroom level: after all, that\u2019s where the effects of high-level policy decisions ultimately play out. Starting from the basics and progressing through to the deeper aspects of education policy, this text provides an excellent introduction to a subject that lies at the foundation of every education system. This second edition includes a new chapter on issues relating to policy implementation, as well as new discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Topics include: A beginner\u2019s overview of education policy studies. How values influence policy-making. How education policy is developed, implemented, and evaluated. The role of policy in education reform. The future of education policy as schools adapt to changing societies.",

        "description": "This book debunks the argument that quality in education can only be achieved by limiting, or trading off, equality. The quality of schooling is a major issue for Third World nations across the globe. However there is no single measure which is universally accepted. Whether it is, as some economists might argue, an issue of the number of desks per classroom or one of national sovereignty is widely disputed. Defining equality in education becomes increasingly difficult in an era of globalization in which there exists a wide gap between rich and poor, both within and between nations. In the context of an international move towards New Right politics and neo-liberal economic ideologies, both the quality and equality of education are imperiled. This book argues that any worthy definition of quality education must include the interests and participation of the underprivileged.",

Governors become more powerful, parents took on a greater influence and employers were given new rights. This book discusses the total management of schools as they respond to these new imperatives. It examines the responsibilities of Teachers, Head Teachers and Principals as they shape and execute their management plans. Against the background of a compulsory National Curriculum, the book also examines the management of the diverse pressures within the curriculum itself.",

The job of deciding where students will be educated, what they will be taught, who will teach them, and how it will be paid for clearly rests with some mix of district, state, and national policymakers. This book seeks to show how global trends have produced similar changes to very different educational systems in the United States and Japan. Despite different historical development, social norms, and institutional structures, the U.S. and Japanese education systems have been restructured over the past dozen years, not just incrementally but in ways that have transformed traditional power arrangements. Based on 124 interviews, this book examines two restructuring episodes in U.S. education and two restructuring episodes in Japanese education. The four episodes reveal a similar politics of structural education reform that is driven by symbolic action and bureaucratic turf wars, which has ultimately hindered educational improvement in both countries.",

        "description": "This volume is a path-breaking contribution to the study of efforts of diaspora, indigenous, and minority groups, broadly defined, to use education (formal and informal) to sustain cultural continuity while grappling with the influences and demands of wider globalizing, nationalizing, or other homogenizing and assimilatory forces. Particular attention is given to groups that use educational elements other than second-language teaching alone in programs to sustain their particular cultural traditions. The focus of the book on cultural sustainability changes the nature of questions posed in multicultural education from those that address the opening of boundaries to issues of preserving boundaries in an open yet sustainable way. As forced and elective immigration trends are changing the composition of societies and the educational systems within them -- bringing a rich diversity of cultural experience to the teaching/learning process -- diaspora, indigenous, and minority groups are looking more and more for ways to sustain their cultures in the context of wider socio-political influences. This volume is a first opportunity to consider critically multicultural efforts in dialogue with educational options that are culturally particularistic but at the same time tolerant. Academics will find this an excellent reference book. Practitioners will draw inspiration in learning of others\u2019 efforts to sustain cultures, and will engage in critical reflection on their own work vis-\u00e0-vis that of others. Teachers will realize they do not stand alone in their educational efforts and will uncover new strategies and methodologies through which to approach their work.",

It covers both classical engineering and emerging fields, such as bioengineering, nanotechnology, and mechatronics. The book is organized into two parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the engineering discipline. It begins with a discussion of what engineers do and then covers topics such as the key elements of engineering analysis; problems solving and spreadsheet analyses; and the kinds, conversion, and conservation of energy. The book also discusses key concepts drawn from the fields of chemical engineering; mechanical engineering; electrical engineering; electrochemical engineering; materials engineering; civil engineering; engineering kinematics; bioengineering; manufacturing engineering; and engineering economics. Part 2 focuses on the steps in the engineering design process. It provides content for a Design Studio, where students can design and build increasingly complex engineering system. It also presents examples of design competitions and concludes with brief remarks about the importance of design projects. Organized in two parts to cover both the concepts and practice of engineering: Part I, Minds On, introduces the fundamental physical, chemical and material bases for all engineering work while Part II, Hands On, provides opportunity to do design projects An Engineering Ethics Decision Matrix is introduced in Chapter 1 and used throughout the book to pose ethical challenges and explore ethical decision-making in an engineering context Lists of \"Top Engineering Achievements\" and \"Top Engineering Challenges\" help put the material in context and show engineering as a vibrant discipline involved in solving societal problemsNew to this edition: Additional discussions on what engineers do, and the distinctions between engineers, technicians, and managers (Chapter 1) New coverage of Renewable Energy and Environmental Engineering helps emphasize the emerging interest in Sustainable Engineering New discussions of Six Sigma in the Design section, and expanded material on writing technical reports Re-organized and updated chapters in Part I to more closely align with specific engineering disciplines new end of chapter excercises throughout the book",

'I enjoyed every inch of the way, from Parliament Hill to the Pergola... A late-life little masterpiece' Ferdinand Mount 'A love letter, both to the Heath and to his late wife' Islington Tribune 'An affectionate book which blends personal anecdote, history and interviews' Ham & High The eight hundred acres of Hampstead Heath lie just four miles from central London; and yet unlike the manicured inner-city parks, it feels like the countryside: it has hills and lakes, wild spots and tame spots. Hunter Davies has lived within a stone's throw of Hampstead Heath for more than sixty years and has walked on it nearly every day of his London life. For him, it is not just a place of recreation and relaxation but also a treasure-house of memories and emotions. In The Heath, he visits all parts of this, the largest area of common land in Britain's capital city: from Kenwood House to the Vale of Health, from Parliament Hill to Boudicca's Mound, and from the Ladies Bathing Pond to the fabulous pergola. As he walks, Davies talks to the diverse array of individuals who frequent the Heath: regulars; visitors; dog walkers; stall holders at the weekly farmer's market; famous faces having their morning stroll; twenty-first-century hippies spreading peace, love and happiness.",

        "description": "Only now is it possible to see Edward Heath's controversial administration (1970-1974) in balanced historical perspective - and increasingly it seems a turning-point for postwar Britain. This timely volume explores the agenda of the Heath government in all its aspects (including economy, industrial relations, social policy, immigration, Northern Ireland, British entry into Europe, and foreign relations), assesses how far it achieved its aims, and examines the response to them. The book is based upon much new research, including the archives of the Conservative Party and the TUC, and interviews with many of those involved at the heart of government. The result will be essential reading for anyone interested in modern British history, politics and government. Contributors include PAUL ARTHUR, LEWIS BASTON, VERNON BOGDANOR, ALEC CAIRNCROSS, CHRISTOPHER HILL, DENNIS KAVANAGH, ZIG LAYTON-HENRY, CHRISTOPHER LORD, RODNEY LOWE, JOHN RAMSDEN, ROBERT TAYLOR, KEVIN THEAKSTON, JOHN YOUNG.",

It provides a unique glimpse into the administrative operations and inner workings of the army during the American Revolution. Major General William Heath offers rare insights on the war\u2019s major military personalities on both the American and British sides. Of particular interest are his wartime interactions with British generals John Burgoyne and William Phillips, as well as Continental Army generals such as George Washington and Charles Lee. Heath\u2019s memoir also gives readers a detailed look at the constant struggles faced by the army, including food, supply, personnel and funding shortages, and presents an almost daily chronicle of the tribulations and successes experienced by patriot forces during the war.",

They did so in the context of an emergent New Conservatism, championed by the likes of Enoch Powell, Keith Joseph and Nigel Lawson, which betokened a long-term change from the post-war Butskellite settlement. Against a national background of declining economic status, high inflation, debilitating public sector strikes and internal Conservative Party debates, particularly over industrial relations policy and monetarism, they adopted strikingly different approaches to policy-making in Opposition. The book illustrates how, paradoxically, Heath\u2019s technocratic over-prescription failed to save his eventual premiership, while Thatcher\u2019s under-committed policy design failed to impede her leading a purposeful and transformative government i n the 1980s.",

        "description": "The American legal system today is the most significant in the world, yet until the publication of Fundamentals of American Law, there has been no book that provides both the basic rules on the theoretical understanding necessary to comprehend. This book is not simply the work of a singleauthor, but a collection of especially written essays, each by an expert in the field, all of whom are on the faculty of New York University School of Law, which is recognized as one of the elite law schools in America and which offers this book as an element of its unique Global Law SchoolProgramme.The book is written specifically for foreign lawyers and law students who have a need to deal with American Law generally, but are not seeking to become specialists in any one area. For them, it is vital to understand the basic principles of a wide range of American legal fields so they can act asinformed intermediaries between their public or private clients and their American counterparts. The book not only provides the reader with a solid foundation in American law, but will also serve as a basic reference book for the fundamentals, even as some of the details change over the years.Although initially conceived to fill a void for foreign lawyers, the book is also ideally suited for others who have a significant need to understand the basic principles of American Law and to interact with American lawyers. For this reason it will be an ideal course text for students of business,accountancy, political science, or public administration, where the enquiring student will constantly find intersections with the law.The book is more than a compendium of legal principles. Each chapter explains not only what the law is, but why it is that way. It sets forth the policy considerations in institutional factors that produce a particular law so the reader can make an independent judgement about its wisdom and perhapsits adaptibility to other cultures.",

This fully revised and updated fourth edition provides contemporary examples to demonstrate the relevance of these arguments in the twenty-first century. The book includes an analysis of the common sense of law; the use of anthropological examples to gain external perspectives of our use and understanding of law; a consideration of central legal concepts, such as order, rules, property, dispute resolution, legitimation and the rule of law; an examination of the role of law in women's subordination and finally a critique of the effect of our understanding of law upon the wider world. Clearly written and admirably suited to provoking discussions on the role of law in our contemporary world, this book is ideal for undergraduate and postgraduate students reading law, and will be of interest to those studying legal systems and skills courses, jurisprudence courses, and law and society.",

        "description": "Awareness of the need to deepen the method and methodology of legal research is only recent. The same is true for comparative law, by nature a more adventurous branch of legal research, which is often something researchers simply do, whenever they look at foreign legal systems to answer one or more of a range of questions about law, whether these questions are doctrinal, economic, sociological, etc. Given the diversity of comparative research projects, the precise contours of the methods employed, or the epistemological issues raised by them, are to a great extent a function of the nature of the research questions asked. As a result, the search for a unique, one-size-fits-all comparative law methodology is unlikely to be fruitful. That however does not make reflection on the method and culture of comparative law meaningless. Mark Van Hoecke has, throughout his career, been interested in many topics, but legal theory, comparative law and methodology of law stand out. Building upon his work, this book brings together a group of leading authors working at the crossroads of these themes: the method and culture of comparative law.

This text then discusses mathematics as a system of structure or as a collection of substructures. Other chapters consider the four essential components in a mathematical or logical system or structure, namely, undefined terms, defined terms, postulates, and theorems. This book discusses as well several principles used in numeration systems and provides examples of some numeration systems that are in use to illustrate these principles. The final chapter deals with the classification of certain mathematical systems as groups, fields, or rings to demonstrate some abstract mathematics.

It provides new ideas and research for scientists developing and studying mathematical methods and algorithms, and researchers applying them for solving real-life problems. The importance of the computing infrastructure is unquestionable for the development of modern science. The main focus of the book is the application of mathematics to industry and science. It promotes basic research in mathematics leading to new methods and techniques useful to industry and science. The volume also considers strategy-making integration between scientists of applied mathematics and those working in applied informatics, which has potential for long-lasting integration and co-operation. The integration role is regarded here as a tool for consolidation and reinforcement of the research, education and training, and for the transfer of scientific and management knowledge. This volume operates as a medium for the exchange of information and ideas between mathematicians and other technical and scientific personnel. The book will be essential for the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration between applied mathematics and science, engineering and technology. The main topics examined in this volume are: numerical methods and algorithms; control systems and applications; partial differential equations and real-life applications; the high performance of scientific computing; linear algebra applications; neurosciences; algorithms in industrial mathematics; equations of mathematical physics; and industrial applications of mechanics.",

It combines critical scholarship with the voice of expert clinicians who work at the interface of psychiatry with medical specialties. It is meant to be read for pleasure as well as consulted as a reference. The editors have worked with the authors to bring a consistent perspective to the book - one that sees the medical psychiatrist as an agent for bringing a more comprehensive perspective to medical care. Even seasoned and knowledgeable practitioners will find much that is new to them in this book. The volume covers topics in depth that other books in the field may not cover at all, such as the use of herbal and nutritional therapies for medical-psychiatric symptoms and syndromes, and the choice of questionnaires to supplement history-taking. It looks at old topics in a new way: The chapter on the physical examination applies psychometric considerations to the Babinski sign, describes the method and application of quantitative bedside olfactory testing, and discusses smartphone apps to improve the sensitivity of the examination. Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient, 3rd Edition provides concepts and information to facilitate the dialogue between psychiatrists and general medical specialists - minimizing psychiatric jargon and speaking in the common language of caring and curious physicians.",

        "description": "A fresh look at the history of psychology placed in its social, political, and cultural contexts A History of Modern Psychology in Context presents the history of modern psychology in the richness of its many contexts. The authors resist the traditional storylines of great achievements by eminent people, or schools of thought that rise and fall in the wake of scientific progress. Instead, psychology is portrayed as a network of scientific and professional practices embedded in specific temporal, social, political, and cultural contexts. The narrative is informed by three key concepts\u2014indigenization, reflexivity, and social constructionism\u2014and by the fascinating interplay between disciplinary Psychology and everyday psychology. The authors complicate the notion of who is at the center and who is at the periphery of the history of psychology by bringing in actors and events that are often overlooked in traditional accounts. They also highlight how the reflexive nature of Psychology\u2014a science produced both by and about humans\u2014accords history a prominent place in understanding the discipline and the theories it generates. Throughout the text, the authors show how Psychology and psychologists are embedded in cultures that indelibly shape how the discipline is defined and practiced, the kind of knowledge it creates, and how this knowledge is received. The text also moves beyond an exclusive focus on the development of North American and European psychologies to explore the development of psychologies in other indigenous contexts, especially from the mid-20th-century onward.",

The study focuses not on dismantling the rational core of scientific practice, but on illustrating how social, personal, and cognitive processes are intricately woven together in scientific thinking. The book is thus a contribution to science studies, the psychology of science, and general psychology.",

Unique features include four chapters addressing the content of stereotypes, which consider such topics as why certain traits are the focus of stereotyping and how they become attributed to particular groups.

Taking their cue and call from Socrates\u2019 summons to \u2018know thyself\u2019, contemporary philosophical counsellors and practitioners have returned to the ancient understanding of philosophy as consolation and contemplation, as a life directed to the loving search for wisdom and clarity. Socrates and the Stoics continued this tradition, seeing philosophy primarily as a practical way of living in alignment with oneself and the logos. Thus interpreted, philosophy is a path, teaches a method more than pronounces a thesis, and issues a living praxis devoted to daily spiritual exercises whose aim is nothing less than the transformation of the self \u2013 a metamorphosis of the personality. This conception of philosophy\u2019s essence was lost, but was later retrieved by certain philosophers, such as Viktor Frankl and Ludwig Wittgenstein, in the twentieth-century, who have unleashed and uncovered philosophy\u2019s original therapeutic impulse and intent. As such, this book will prove of inestimable value to philosophers, psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, counsellors, clients, and students of these disciplines.",

        "description": "This book represents a new approach to philosophy. It treats philosophy as not a collection of systems, but as a study of problems. It recognizes in traditional philosophical systems the historical function of having asked questions rather than having given solutions. Professor Reichenbach traces the failures of the systems to psychological causes. Speculative philosophers offered answers at a time when science had not yet provided the means to give true answers. Their search for certainty and for moral directives led them to accept pseudo-solutions. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and many others are cited to illustrate the rationalist fallacy: reason, unaided by observation, was regarded as a source of knowledge, revealing the physical world and \"moral truth.\" The empiricists could not disprove this thesis, for they could not give a valid account of mathematical knowledge. Mathematical discoveries in the early nineteenth century cleared the way for modern scientific philosophy. Its advance was furthered by discoveries in modern physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. These findings have made possible a new conception of the universe and of the atom. The work of scientists thus altered philosophy completely and brought into being a philosopher with a new attitude and training. Instead of dictating so-called laws of reason to the scientist, this modern philosopher proceeds by analyzing scientific methods and results. He finds answers to the age-old questions of space, time, causality, and life; of the human observer and the external world. He tells us how to find our way through this world without resorting to unjustifiable beliefs or assuming a supernatural origin for moral standards. Philosophy thus is no longer a battleground of contradictory opinions, but a science discovering truth step by step. Professor Reichenbach, known for his many contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, addresses this book to a wider audience. He writes for those who do not have the leisure or preparation to read in the fields of mathematics, symbolic logic, or physics. Besides showing the principal foundations of the new philosophy, he has been careful to provide the necessary factual background. He has written a philosophical study, not a mere popularization. It contains within its chapters all the necessary scientific material in an understandable form\u2014and, therefore, conveys all the information indispensable to a modern world-view. The late Hans Reichenbach was Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles. His previous books include",

Avrum Stroll persuasively argues that philosophy should be evaluated using its own methodology and should not merely mimic formal scientific analysis, because while modern science does inform our philosophical views about man and his place in nature, it does not solve philosophical problems. Stroll effectively makes the case for the use of informal philosophy\u2014that is, an approach guided by common sense, appealing to ordinary discourse, and employing a context-driven line of inquiry\u2014to answer philosophical problems.",

        "description": "Philosophy is the quest for a life that is fully alive. Drawing on the insights of philosophers through the ages, The Way of Philosophy clarifies what it means to live life intensely. It exposes the shallowness of conventional wisdom by asking such questions as -Can science know everything? -Should we do it if it feels good? -Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? -Is life about creating ourselves? -Is love supposed to be selfless? -Can we ignore death? -If God exists, why is he hiding? Philosophers invite us to go down deep and live a life in light of truth, goodness, and beauty. If we tread this path, we can discover for ourselves the hidden source of the philosophical life in the unending wellspring of wonder. \"\"This work is a call to wonder! Professor Engelland has reflected deeply on the questions that move the human heart--love, beauty, goodness, truth. These pages thus serve as a form of spiritual exercise for thinkers, aiming to arouse us from our various levels of psychic torpor and to bring us to see the marvels of existence at all levels.\"\" --David Meconi, Professor of Theology, Saint Louis University; Editor, Homiletic and Pastoral Review \"\"This is a beautiful little introduction to philosophy, which, with its humor, provocative observations, and clever anecdotes and examples, will draw students in before they know what's happening. Engelland does a marvelous job of speaking plainly and directly to students without diluting philosophical content, and of opening up classical themes in a fresh and unpretentious way.\"\" --D. C.

        "description": "Thinking about Thinking examines philosophy from a variety of perspectives as a the practice realized by persons who communicate with one another while reflecting about the meaning of human life and thought. Without forgetting the logical and methodological conditions of systematic thought, the author insists on the intimate connections that tie all philosophical texts and conversations to the lives from which they emerge. As product of an individual thinker, who, thanks to individual teachers, has been familiarized with particular traditions of a particular culture, each philosophy is unique. If it is a good one, it is also revealing for many--perhaps even for all--other philosophers. At the same time, all thinking is addressed to individual interlocutors, each of whom responds to it by transforming it into a different philosophy. This fact invites us to explore the dialogical dimension of thinking, which, in turn, refers us to the communitarian and historical contexts from which solitude, as well as solidarity, competition, alliances, and friendships in thought emerge. After the collapse of modern autonomy, the question of philosophy's dependence on prephilosophical conditions is a basic question of metaphilosophy -- especially if a philosophy is always entangled with or even rooted in some belief or trust or faith.",

        "description": "A great fissure occurred in Western civilization in the early modern period with the divorce between the humanities and the sciences and the rise of scientific naturalism. The Metaphysics of Self and World is a philosophical exploration of the relationship between the individual, the culture, and the world. It is, in the author's words, \"a philosophy of the humanities, a philosophy of humanity, and a philosophy of social reality.\" It explores the implications of a world-view that would integrate the perspective of the sciences with humanistic ways of thought. E.M. Adams claims that we do violence to ourselves as human beings by trying to fit into the world as delineated in scientific categories. Rejecting cultural subjectivism and scientific naturalism, he argues for the irreducibility and validity of the categories of the humanities and for a fully developed humanistic philosophy of self and world. In generating this world-view, he utilizes the humanities as a source of culture therapy in order to close the fissure in Western civilization. Author note: E. M. Adams is Kenan Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has written numerous books and articles, and a festschrift celebrating his work, Mind, Value, and Culture: Essays in Honor of E. M. Adams (edited by David Weissbord), was published in 1989.",

In the second edition of this popular book, William Fish introduces the subject thematically, setting out the major theories of perception together with their motivations and attendant problems. While providing historical background to debates in the field, this comprehensive overview focuses on recent presentations and defenses of the different theories, and looks beyond visual perception to take into account the role of other senses. The second edition organizes the contents into two main parts: the first deals with philosophical theories of perception, and the second covers key topics and issues in perception as they are discussed in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. Two completely new chapters have been added \u2013 one on color and color vision; and a second on the interaction between sense modalities \u2013 and other chapters have been significantly updated to include discussion of topics such as pre-twentieth-century philosophy of perception, phenomenal intentionality, color adverbialism, predictive processing approaches to perception, ecological approaches to perception, and in-depth discussions of the non-visual senses. Additional updates include fuller and easier-to-understand explanations of some important views that were glossed over in the first edition and greater coverage of research from the last 25 years. All chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter have been brought up to date and the volume now includes a more extensive index at the back of the book. Key Features and Benefits: The only single-authored textbook on philosophy of perception currently available Devoted to contemporary theories and topics, but with appropriate historical coverage for fuller understanding of contemporary work Each chapter includes a chapter overview, questions for further consideration, and an annotated list of Suggested Reading Includes coverage of topics like: the phenomenal principle perception and hallucination perception and content na\u00efve realism and disjunctivism intentionalism and representationalism the nature of content qualia theories and phenomenal intentionality perception and empirical science color and color science theories of non-visual perception Molyneux\u2019s problem cross-modal illusions multimodality Key Changes to the Second Edition The division of the book into two major parts: Part I on philosophical theories of perception, Part II on key interdisciplinary topics in perception The addition of two new chapters on color and color vision, and interaction between different sense modalities More topics from the last 25 years of philosophy of perception Combined chapters on belief acquisition theories and intentional theories into one larger chapter More material on the growing intersection of the philosophy and psychology of perception Includes coverage of Molyneux\u2019s problem and of cross-modal illusions Updated chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter A summary table and a more extensive index",

        "description": "This multivolume set is much more than a collection of essays on sports and sporting cultures from around the world: it also details how and why sports are played wherever they exist, and examines key charismatic athletes from around the world who have transcended their sports. Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice provides a unique, global overview of sports and sports cultures. Unlike most works of this type, this book provides both essays that examine general topics, such as globalization and sport, international relations and sport, and tourism and sport, as well as essays on sports history, culture, and practice in world regions\u2014for example, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, Europe, and Oceania\u2014in order to provide a more global perspective. These essays are followed by entries on specific sports, world athletes, stadiums and arenas, famous games and matches, and major controversies. Spanning topics as varied as modern professional cycling to the fictional movie Rocky to the deadly ball game of the ancient Mayans, the first three volumes contain overview essays and entries for specific sports that have been and are currently practiced around the world. The fourth volume provides a compendium of information on the winners of major sporting competitions from around the world. Readers will gain invaluable insights into how sports have been enjoyed throughout all of human culture, and more fully comprehend their cultural contexts. The entries provide suggestions for further reading on each topic\u2014helpful to general readers, students with school projects, university students and academics alike. Additionally, the four-volume Sports Around the World spotlights key charismatic athletes who have changed a sport or become more than just an outstanding player.",

Key aspects of the Handbook include: an inventory of the principal achievements in the field; a guide to the chief conflicts and difficulties in the theory and research process; a rallying point for researchers who are established or new to the field, which sets the agenda for future developments; a resource book for teachers who wish to establish new curricula and develop courses and programmes in the area of sports studies.

Musculoskeletal and Sports Medicine for the Primary Care Practitioner contains the most current information on major topics in sports science and clinical medicine. It is a valuable resource for primary care physicians and allied health professionals who practice, teach, and hold specialty certifications in sports medicine and related fields. The book discusses key concepts related to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of sports injuries. This edition adds new sections on pro-inflammatory treatments, field-side acupuncture, and brief musculoskeletal ultrasound as well as a new chapter on wellness and video illustrations of important musculoskeletal maneuvers at www.crcpress.com/9781482220117. The book follows the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT), which addresses the quality, quantity, and consistency of evidence. It recommends levels of patient-oriented evidence to assist physicians in their diagnoses. Also included is a link to videos that demonstrate important musculoskeletal maneuvers used in sports medicine. As exercise and sports move beyond the realm of leisurely activity to a necessary component of good health, this book has become an important resource for all those involved in sports medicine.",

They liken the circumstances to previous governments that used the games to glorify their regimes - most notoriously the Nazis in 1936. What has led to this perception and is it fair? Sport, Revolution and the Beijing Olympics is a cultural history of sport in China and challenges many such ingrained Western assumptions. The authors unpick the relationship of sport to imperialism and revolution, and examine its significance in both China and Taiwan at governmental and everyday levels. In the process, they successfully debunk harmful myths, such as the prevalence of drugs in Chinese sport among women athletes, and present a balanced view that is a much-needed corrective to popular understanding.",

In thisVery Short Introduction, Mike Cronin charts the history of sport, from its traditional origins in folk football and cock fighting to its position as a global phenomenon today. Looking at a variety of sports from team games such as rugby, cricket, and football to games for individuals such as golf, tennis, and skiing, he considers how these first emerged and captivated the interest of ordinary people, and how sport has been transformed within our daily lives. Exploring the relationship between sport and class, gender, commerce, identity, and ethics, Cronin considers some of the central issues in sport today, including the high pay of professional footballers and the glamour of women in sports, as well as fair play standards. Charting sport through the ages and around the world, this is a short guide to the history, development, and place of sport in contemporary global society. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

        "description": "New media technologies have become a central part of the sports media landscape. Sports fans use new media to watch games, discuss sports transactions, form fan-based communities, and secure minutiae about their favorite players and teams. Never before have fans known so much about athletes, whether that happens via Twitter feeds, fan sites, or blogs, and never before have the lines between producer, consumer, enactor, fan and athlete been more blurred. The Internet has made virtually everything available for sports media consumption; it has also made understanding sports media substantially more complex. The Routledge Handbook of Sport and New Media is the most comprehensive and in-depth study of the impact of new media in sport ever to be published. Adopting a broad, interdisciplinary approach, the book explores new media in sport as a cultural, social, commercial, economic, and technological phenomenon, examining the profound impact of digital technologies on that the way that sport is produced, consumed and understood. There is no aspect of social life or commercial activity in general that is not being radically influenced by the rise of new media forms, and by offering a \"state of the field\" survey of work in this area, the Routledge Handbook of Sport and New Media is important reading for any advanced student, researcher or practitioner with an interest in sports studies, media studies or communication studies.",

In other sports, athletes assume an almost nomadic migratory lifestyle, constantly on the move from one sport festival to another. In addition, it appears that sport migration is gaining momentum and that it is closely interwoven with the broader process of global sport development taking place in the late twentieth century.",

Muller and Niels Bukh and the Danish Gymnastics revolution with its emphasis on male aesthetics and hygiene in the first half of the twentieth century. At the same time, Denmark has stood apart from Europe in the early moments of its history of sport with the rural revolution of the farming communities as a statement of political independence and assertion. However, during the German occupation of Denmark, Danish sport was part of a European collaboration which characterized a number of the occupied countries not least in the Nordic area. After the Second World War, Denmark embraced international body cultures with other European nations in particular Eastern martial arts. Denmark too, as part of trends in the European region and the world, became caught up in sport as a powerful contemporary political statement. This book was previously published as a special issue of the International Journal of the History of Sport.",

The series, Philosophy and Technology, inaugurated in this form with this volume, is the official publication of the Society for Philosophy & Technology. Approximately one volume each year is tobe published, alternating between proceedings volumes - taken from contributions to biennial international conferences of the Society - and miscellaneous volumes, with roughly the character of a professional society journal. The forerunners of the series in its present form were two proceedings volumes: Philosophy and Technology (1983), edited by Paul T. Durbin and Friedrich Rapp, and Philosophy and Technology //: Information Technology and Computers in Theory and Practice (1986), edited by Carl Mitcham and Alois Huning - both published (as volumes 80 and 90, respectively) in the series, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. The Society for Philosophy & Technology, now more than ten years old, is devoted to the promotion of philosophical schalarship that deals in one way or another with technology and technological society. \"Philosophical scholarship\" is interpreted broadly as including contribu tions from any and all perspectives; the one requirement is that the schalarship be sound, and all contributions to the series are subject to rigorous blind refereeing. \"Technology,\" the other half of the philos ophy-and-technology pairing, is also construed broadly.",

        "description": "Radical technological changes (so-called \"technology shocks\") frequently disrupt the competitive market structure. New entrants appear, industries need to be redefined, incumbents lose their positions or vanish completely. Fast moving industries - like the often quoted example of the semiconductor industry - have preferably been analyzed for these phenomena. But do the findings hold for industries with longer development cycles like the global machine tool industry? Here, multivariate analysis is used to find out what management needs to focus on in order to lead companies through the technology shocks. The research for this book builds on in-depth interviews with 100 experts and decision makers from the machine tool industry involved in technology shocks and statistical analysis of detailed quantitative surveys collected from 58 companies. In several instances the results challenge classical teaching of technology management. Adrian J. Slywotzky - US top selling business author and one of the most distinguished intellectual leaders in business - comments: \"In Technology Shocks, Heinrich Arnold develops a very useful model for analyzing technology shocks, and for focusing on those factors that will enable a company to navigate through these shocks successfully, and repeatedly. Although this work is focused on technology, its thinking has useful implications beyond technology shocks. It provides ideas that managers can use to protect their firms when they are faced with any type of discontinuity, technology-based or not\".",

        "description": "Only recently has the phenomenon of technology become an object of in terest for philosophers. The first attempts at a philosophy of technology date back scarcely a hundred years - a span of time extremely short when com pared with the antiquity of philosophical reflections on nature, science, and society. Over that hundred-year span, speculative, critical, and empiricist approaches of various sorts have been put forward. Nevertheless, even now there remains a broad gap between the importance of technology in the real world and the sparse number of philosophical works dedicated to the under standing of modern technology. As a result of the complex structure of modern technology, it can be dealt with in very different ways. These range from metaphysical exposition to efforts aimed at political consensus. Quite naturally, within such a broad range, certain national accents can be discovered-; they are shaped by a com mon language, accepted philosophical traditions, and concrete problems requiring consideration. Even so, the worldwide impact of technology, its penetration into all spheres of individual, social, and cultural life, together with the urgency of the problems raised in this context - all these demand a joint philosophical discussion that transcends the barriers of language and cultural differences. The papers printed here are intended to exemplify such an effort at culture-transcending philosophical discussion.",

        "description": "This is the first volume to focus specifically on Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s dramatic literature, visiting translations and adaptations of Tagore\u2019s drama, and cross-cultural encounters in his works. As Asia\u2019s first Nobel Laureate, Tagore\u2019s highly original plays occupy a central position in the Indian theatrescape. Tagore experimented with dance, music, dance drama, and plays, exploring concepts of environment, education, gender and women, postcolonial encounters, romantic idealism, and universality. Tagore\u2019s drama plays a generous host to experimentations with new performance modes, like the writing and staging of an all-women play on stage for the first time, or the use of cross-cultural styles such as Manipuri dance, Thai craft in stage design, or the Baul singing styles. This book is an exciting re-exploration of Tagore\u2019s plays, visiting issues such as his contribution to Indian drama, drama and environment, feminist readings, postcolonial engagements, cross-cultural encounters, drama as performance, translational and adaptation modes, the non-translated or the non-translatable Tagore drama, Tagore drama in the 21st century, and Indian film. The volume serves as a wide-ranging and up-to-date resource on the criticism of Tagore drama, and will appeal to a range of Theatre and Performance scholars as well as those interested in Indian theatre, literature, and film.",

This practical handbook offers teachers an array of simple and easy-to-implement theatrical techniques that will enhance students' learning and encourage artistic expression. The author demonstrates how dramatic play doesn't have to be restricted to drama lessons and can be applied to a diverse range of school subjects and recreational settings. 'The Little Red Hen', for example, covers themes that are relevant to literacy (rhyming and rhythm), maths (counting seeds), science (discussing farming), and art lessons (designing costumes). Step-by-step lesson plans take teachers through every aspect of running fun and engaging story dramas, including warm ups, movement, songs and props. Handy tips throughout suggest ideas for developing the plays further and ways to adapt them according to the needs of the group. This book will be an essential and comprehensive guide for anyone interested in drama as an educational tool in inclusive or special needs settings.",

It offers a detailed analysis and explores the roles of actor, director and playwright that the teacher must adopt in order to develop the \u2018thinking on your feet\u2019 skills and knowledge necessary to deliver a complete process drama experience. Addressing the dynamic nature of process drama, it provides a clear and rigorous explanation of the theory of process drama and links it to practice. Drawing on a wide range of detailed examples from the authors\u2019 international and cross-cultural practice, it demonstrates how an effective process drama operates in action. Written to help practitioners and students produce powerful, artistic and educative experiences, chapters cover: pedagogy and the improvised nature of the art form; the structural framework and making shifts in the drama; the role of actor, director, playwright and teacher; monitoring emotional range; progression and the importance of reflection; the spiral of creative exchange and the complexities of co-creativity. Putting Process Drama into Action will be an essential guide for students undertaking initial teacher training at primary level, in addition to those studying both Drama and English at secondary level. It will also prove to be essential reading for specialist and non-specialist teachers in the primary and secondary sectors who teach, or wish to teach, process drama.",

The International LGBT Rights Movement offers a comprehensive account of this global force, from its origins in the mid-nineteenth century to its crucial place in world affairs today. Belmonte examines the movement's goals, the disputes about its mission, and its rise to international importance. The International LGBT Rights Movement provides a thorough introduction to the movement's history, highlighting key figures, controversies, and organizations. With a global scope that considers both state and non-state actors, the book explores transnational movements to challenge homophobia, while also assessing the successes and failures of these efforts along the way.",

        "description": "Beginning from the First People, through the influx of European settlers and the slave trade from Africa, to the modern era, this book presents and discusses documents that reflect pivotal moments in the LGBT rights movement in North America. While most would think of the modern Gay Rights Movement as beginning in the 1960s, in reality, the issue of nonheterosexual human behavior within society and the campaign to achieve equality and acceptance have existed far earlier. Beginning with the First People in the Americas and their acceptance of tribal members who did not conform to gender and sexual binary roles, to the expansion west and establishment of the United States as a Republic, to the contentious struggles for equality in the 20th and 21st centuries, this reference traces the development of the Gay Rights Movement through the examination of primary source materials related to the incremental changes toward making America safe for all people. These documents enable readers to reflect on pivotal moments in the LGBT rights and sexual equality movement in the past up to the achievement of marriage equality. A modern chronology traces key events in the Gay Rights Movement across the last 70 years, such as those during the World War II era, the formation of the Mattachine Society in Los Angeles in the 1950s, to the Stonewall Riot in New York in the late 1960s, the elimination of the category of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973, the judgment in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court that laws criminalizing sodomy are unconstitutional, and the legalization of same-sex marriage in all U.S. states in 2015.",

        "description": "In persuading the Supreme Court that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, the LGBT rights movement has achieved its most important objective of the last few decades. Throughout its history, the marriage equality movement has been criticized by those who believe marriage rights were a conservative cause overshadowing a host of more important issues. Now that nationwide marriage equality is a reality, everyone who cares about LGBT rights must grapple with how best to promote the interests of sexual and gender identity minorities in a society that permits same-sex couples to marry. This book brings together 12 original essays by leading scholars of law, politics, and society to address the most important question facing the LGBT movement today: What does marriage equality mean for the future of LGBT rights? After Marriage Equality explores crucial and wide-ranging social, political, and legal issues confronting the LGBT movement, including the impact of marriage equality on political activism and mobilization, antidiscrimination laws, transgender rights, LGBT elders, parenting laws and policies, religious liberty, sexual autonomy, and gender and race differences. The book also looks at how LGBT movements in other nations have responded to the recognition of same-sex marriages, and what we might emulate or adjust in our own advocacy. Aiming to spark discussion and further debate regarding the challenges and possibilities of the LGBT movement\u2019s future, After Marriage Equality will be of interest to anyone who cares about the future of sexual equality.",

        "description": "\" American public opinion tends to be sticky. Although the news cycle might temporarily affect the public zeitgeist about abortion, the death penalty, or gun control, public support or opposition on these issues has remained remarkably constant over decades. But there are notable exceptions, particularly with regard to polarizing issues that highlight identity politics. Over the past three decades, public support for same-sex marriage has risen from scarcely more than a tenth to a majority of the population. Why have people's minds changed so dramatically on this issue, and why so quickly? Listen, We Need to Talk tests a theory that when prominent people representing particular interest groups voice support for a culturally contentious issue, they sway the opinions of others who identify with the same group, even if the interest group and the issue at hand have no obvious connection. In fact this book shows that the more the message counters prevailing beliefs or attitudes of a particular identity group, the more persuasive it is. While previous studies of political attitude change have looked at the effects of message priming (who delivers a message) on issues directly related to particular identity groups, this study is unique in that it looks at how identity priming affects attitudes and behaviors toward an issue that is not central or directly related to the targeted group. The authors prove their theory through a series of random experiments testing the positive effects of identity-based messaging regarding same-sex marriage among fans of professional sports, religious groups, and ethnoracial (Black and Latino) groups. \"--",

V. Lee Badgett argues that in addition to moral and human rights reasons for equality, we can now also make a financial argument. Finding that homophobia and transphobia cost 1% or more of a country\u2019s GDP, Badgett expertly uses recent research and statistics to analyze how these hostile practices and environments affect both the US and global economies. LGBT equality remains a persistent and pertinent issue. The continued passing of discriminatory laws, people being fired from jobs for their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, harassment and bullying in school, violence and hate crimes on the streets, exclusion from intolerant families, and health effects of stigma all make it incredibly difficult to live a good life. Examining the consequences of anti-LGBT practices across multiple countries, including the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, India and the Philippines, Badgett reveals the expensive repercussions of hate and discrimination, and how our economy loses when we miss out on the full benefit of LGBT people\u2019s potential contributions.",

The authors are scientists from the areas of literature, linguistics, sociology, psychology, history, communications, the theater, and Jewish studies. They all try to understand different aspects of Jewish humor, and they evoke associations, of a local-logical nature, with Jewish tradition. This compilation reflects the first interdisciplinary approach to Jewish humor. The chapters are arranged in four parts. The first section relates to humor as a way of coping with Jewish identity. Joseph Dorinson's chapter underscores the dilemma facing Jewish comedians in the United States. These comics try to assimilate into American culture, but without giving up their Jewish identity. The second section of the book deals with a central function of humor\u00e2\u0080\u0094aggression. Christie Davies makes a clear distinction between jokes that present the Jew as a victim of anti-Semitic attacks and those in which the approach is not aggressive. The third part focuses on humor in the Jewish tradition. Lawrence E. Mintz writes about jokes involving Jewish and Christian clergymen. The last part of the book deals with humor in Israel. David Alexander talks about the development of satire in Israel. Other chapters and contributors include: \"Psycho-Social Aspects of Jewish Humor in Israel and in the Diaspora\" by Avner Ziv; \"Humor and Sexism: The Case of the Jewish Joke\" by Esther Fuchs; \"Halachic Issues as Satirical Elements in Nineteenth Century Hebrew Literature\" by Yehuda Friedlander; \"Do Jews in Israel still laugh at themselves?\" by O. Nevo; and \"Political Caricature as a Reflection of Israel's Development\" by Kariel Gardosh. Each chapter in this volume paves the way for understanding the many facets of Jewish humor. This book will be immensely enjoyable and informative for sociologists, psychologists, and scholars of Judaic studies.",

Using a combination of interview materials, survey data, and historical materials, the book explores the relationship between humor and gender, age, regional background, and especially, humor and social class in the Netherlands. The final chapter focuses on national differences, exploring the differences between the American and the Dutch sense of humor, again using a combination of interview and survey materials. The starting point for this exploration of differences in sense of humor is one specific humorous genre: the joke. The joke is not a very prestigious genre; in the Netherlands even less so than in the US. It is precisely this lack of status that made it a good starting point for asking questions about humor and taste. Interviewees generally had very pronounced opinions about the genre, calling jokes \"their favorite kind humor\", but also \"completely devoid of humor\" and \"a form of intellectual poverty\". Good Humor, Bad Taste attempts to explain why jokes are good humor to some, bad taste to others. The focus on this one genre enables Good Humor, Bad Taste to have a very wide scope. The book not only covers the appreciation and evaluation of jokes by different social groups and in different cultures, and its relationship with wider humor styles. It also describes the genre itself: the history of the genre, its decline in status from the sixteenth century onward, and the way the topics and the tone of jokes have changed over the last fifty years of the twentieth century.",

        "description": "This book addresses psychological studies of humour in Chinese societies. It starts by reviewing how the concept of humour evolves in Chinese history, and how it is perceived by Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism respectively. It then compares differences in the Western and the Chinese perceptions of humor and discusses empirical studies that were conducted to examine such differences. It also discusses the cultural origin and empirical evidence of the Chinese ambivalence about humor and presents empirical findings that illustrate its existence. Having done these, it proceeds to discuss psychological studies that examine how humour is related to various demographic, dispositional variables as well as how humour is related to creativity in Chinese societies. It also discusses how humour is related to emotional expressions and mental health in Chinese society as well. It concludes with a discussion on how workplace humor is reflected and developed in Chinese contexts. Taken together, this book attempts to bring together the theoretical propositions, empirical studies, and cultural analyses of humor in Chinese societies.",

Using content analysis of primary debates for both Republican and Democratic parties during the 2008 presidential election, Patrick A. Stewart considers not just how humor was used, who used it, and how successful these attempts at humor were, but he also gives readers insight regarding why humor and the laughter that results is an important part of politics. Not only can humor reveal a candidate\u2019s intelligence, values, personality, and his/her connection with the audience, it also reveals the underlying values of egalitarian political systems.",

        "description": "This book deals with the construction of diverse forms of humor in everyday oral, written, and mediatized interactions. It sheds light on the differences and, most importantly, the similarities in the production of interactional humor in face-to-face and various technology-mediated forms of communication, including scripted and non-scripted situations. The chapters analyze humor-related issues in such genres as spontaneous conversations, broadcast dialogues, storytelling, media blogs, bilingual conversations, stand-up comedy, TV documentaries, drama series, family sitcoms, Facebook posts, and internet memes. The individual authors trace how speakers collaboratively circulate, reconstruct, and (re)frame either personal or public accounts of reality, aiming \u2013among other things\u2013 to produce and/or reproduce humor. Rather than being \u201cfinished\u201d products with a \u201csingle\u201d interpretation, humorous texts are thus approached as dynamic communicative events that give rise to diverse interpretations and meanings. The book draws on a variety of up-to-date approaches and methodologies, and will appeal to scholars in discourse analysis, conversation analysis, interactional sociolinguistics, pragmatics, ethnography of communication, and social semiotics.",

Theoretical views of humor range from the physiological to the sociological and anthropological. The relations between humor, laughter, and smiling are considered, along with the connection between collative variables and arousal. Comprised of 13 chapters, this book begins with an introduction to the history of thought and major theoretical issues on humor, followed by a description of models of different aspects of humor. The next section deals with empirical issues in which selected research areas are given detailed attention. The relations between humor, laughter, and smiling, on the one hand, and collative variables and arousal, on the other, are analyzed. Subsequent chapters explore the cognitive origins of incongruity humor by comparing fantasy assimilation and reality assimilation; a two-stage model for the appreciation of jokes and cartoons; and the social functions and physiological correlates of humor. The relationship between arousal potential and funniness of jokes is also explored, together with humor judgments as a function of reference groups and identification classes. The final chapter presents an annotated bibliography of published papers on humor in the research literature and an analysis of trends between 1900 and 1971. This monograph will be of interest to psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and behavioral scientists.",

This graduate-level text develops a more sophisticated approach to household economics, one that allows for multiple-income earners and shared decision-making. This approach is used to present a fundamentally new view of consumption. It then applies this to an analysis of tax systems, combining theoretical analysis of optimal taxation and tax reform with careful empirical study of the characteristics of income tax systems in four different countries: Australia, Germany, the UK and the USA. The book is particularly concerned with analysing, both theoretically and empirically, the impact of taxation on female labour supply, and identifying its effects on work incentives and fairness of income distribution. All this adds up to a fascinating new approach to the economics of household for researchers in both public and private sectors.",

Those who employ people, those who represent workers, those who make laws and those who elect them need economics but may have little time or desire to study it. This book makes economics easily available to everyone. The author\u2019s use of simple language and avoidance of technical jargon provides non-economists with a better understanding of economic reasoning and the tools \"to know and to decide\". The author achieves this through introducing key concepts in short presentations and arming the reader with selected press articles and recent research using these concepts. An analysis of these demonstrates how a general concept can be derived from a specific context and highlighted questions provide the basis for further debate. The reader can then focus on the parts most relevant to their own needs. This book will have great appeal to employers, trade unionists and public officials attending courses organized by international institutions, professional training providers, as well as graduate students of courses where economics is an important element, especially in relation to its policy implications. Finally, it is invaluable for anybody who has wanted to learn the basics of practical economics but has been deterred by its technicalities.",

In an original twist on the NYU Keywords mission, the terms in this volume combine attention to the unique aesthetic practices of a distinct medium, comics, with some of the most fundamental concepts of the humanities broadly. Readers will see how scholars, cultural critics, and comics artists from a range of fields-including media and film studies, queer and feminist theory, and critical race and transgender studies among others-take up sequential art as both an object of analysis and a medium for developing new theories about embodiment, identity, literacy, audience reception, genre, cultural politics and more. To do so, Keywords for Comics Studies presents an array of original and inventive analyses of terms central to the study of comics and sequential art, but traditionally siloed in distinct lexicons: these include creative or aesthetic terms like Ink, Creator, Border, and Panel; conceptual terms like trans*, disability, universe, and fantasy; genre terms, like Zine, Pornography, Superhero, and Manga; and canonical terms like X-Men, Archie, Watchmen and Love and Rockets. Written as much for students and lay readers as professors and experts in the field, Keywords for Comics Studies revivifies the fantasy and magic of reading comics in its kaleidoscopic view of the field's most compelling and imaginative ideas.\"--",

Yet adaptations of comics have been an integral part of American cinema from its very inception, with comics characters regularly leaping from the page to the screen and cinematic icons spawning comics of their own. Movie Comics is the first book to study the long history of both comics-to-film and film-to-comics adaptations, covering everything from silent films starring Happy Hooligan to sound films and serials featuring Dick Tracy and Superman to comic books starring John Wayne, Gene Autry, Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Alan Ladd, and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. With a special focus on the Classical Hollywood era, Blair Davis investigates the factors that spurred this media convergence, as the film and comics industries joined forces to expand the reach of their various brands. While analyzing this production history, he also tracks the artistic coevolution of films and comics, considering the many formal elements that each medium adopted and adapted from the other. As it explores our abiding desire to experience the same characters and stories in multiple forms, Movie Comics gives readers a new appreciation for the unique qualities of the illustrated page and the cinematic moving image.",

        "description": "Entertaining Comics Group (EC Comics) is perhaps best-known today for lurid horror comics like Tales from the Crypt and for a publication that long outlived the company\u2019s other titles, Mad magazine. But during its heyday in the early 1950s, EC was also an early innovator in another genre of comics: the so-called \u201cpreachies,\u201d socially conscious stories that boldly challenged the conservatism and conformity of Eisenhower-era America. EC Comics examines a selection of these works\u2014sensationally-titled comics such as \u201cHate!,\u201d \u201cThe Guilty!,\u201d and \u201cJudgment Day!\u201d\u2014and explores how they grappled with the civil rights struggle, antisemitism, and other forms of prejudice in America. Putting these socially aware stories into conversation with EC\u2019s better-known horror stories, Qiana Whitted discovers surprising similarities between their narrative, aesthetic, and marketing strategies. She also recounts the controversy that these stories inspired and the central role they played in congressional hearings about offensive content in comics. The first serious critical study of EC\u2019s social issues comics, this book will give readers a greater appreciation of their legacy. They not only served to inspire future comics creators, but also introduced a generation of young readers to provocative ideas and progressive ideals that pointed the way to a better America.",

Contributors engage with ethnicity and other cultural forms from Israel, Romania, North America, South Africa, Germany, Spain, U.S. Latino and Canada and consider the ways in which comics are able to represent multiculturalism through a focus on the formal elements of the medium. Discussion themes include education, countercultures, monstrosity, the quotidian, the notion of the \u2018other,\" anthropomorphism, and colonialism. Taking a truly international perspective, the book brings into dialogue a broad range of comics traditions.",

        "description": "This book adopts an intermedial, translational, and transnational approach to the study of the Western genre in European Francophone comics and their English and Spanish translations, offering an innovative form of analysis with potential applications in future research on the translation of comics. Martinez takes the application of Bourdieu\u2019s work on the sociology of culture to translation studies to explore the role of diverse social agents in shaping the products, processes, and reception of translations of Western comics. The book focuses on Jean-Michel Charlier and Jean Giraud\u2019s iconic Blueberry Western comic book series as a lens through which to examine agency and sociocultural norms that influence translations and the degrees to which cartoonists, editors, translators, and censors frame the genre on a global scale. The volume both extends the borders of translation studies research beyond interlingual translation and showcases the study of comics and graphic narratives as an area of inquiry in its own right within the field. This book will be of interest to scholars in translation studies, comics studies, visual culture, and cultural studies.",

How do graphic designers solve problems, organize space, and imbue their work with those visual and symbolic qualities that enable it to convey visual and verbal information with expression and clarity? The extraordinary flowering of graphic design in our time, as a potent means for communication and a major component of our visual culture, increases the need for designers, clients, and students to comprehend its nature. In this lively and lavishly illustrated book, the author reveals the very essence of graphic design. The elements that combine to form a design\u2014 sings, symbols, words, pictures, and supporting forms\u2014are analyzed and explained. Graphic design\u2019s ability to function as language, and the innovative ways that designers combine words and pictures, are discussed. While all visual arts share common spatial properties, the author demonstrates that graphic space has unique characteristics that are determined by its communicative function. Graphic designs can have visual and symbolic properties which empower them to communicate with deep expression and meaning. The author defines this property as graphic resonance and explains how it occurs. After defining design as a problem-solving process, a model for this process is developed and illustrated by an in-depth analysis of actual case histories. This book will provide insight and inspiration for everyone who is interested or involved in graphic communications. While most materials about form and meaning in design have a European origin, this volume is based on the dynamic and expressive graphic design of America. The reader will find inspiration, hundreds of exciting examples by many of America\u2019s outstanding graphic designers, and keen insights in Type and Image.",

Yet they are a modern invention. This book is the first to comprehensively plot humankind's fascinating efforts to visualize data, from a key seventeenth-century precursor--England's plague-driven initiative to register vital statistics--right up to the latest advances. In a highly readable, richly illustrated story of invention and inventor that mixes science and politics, intrigue and scandal, revolution and shopping, Howard Wainer validates Thoreau's observation that circumstantial evidence can be quite convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk. The story really begins with the eighteenth-century origins of the art, logic, and methods of data display, which emerged, full-grown, in William Playfair's landmark 1786 trade atlas of England and Wales. The remarkable Scot singlehandedly popularized the atheoretical plotting of data to reveal suggestive patterns--an achievement that foretold the graphic explosion of the nineteenth century, with atlases published across the observational sciences as the language of science moved from words to pictures. Next come succinct chapters illustrating the uses and abuses of this marvelous invention more recently, from a murder trial in Connecticut to the Vietnam War's effect on college admissions. Finally Wainer examines the great twentieth-century polymath John Wilder Tukey's vision of future graphic displays and the resultant methods--methods poised to help us make sense of the torrent of data in our information-laden world.",

But why do we fill our leisure time with the activities we do? And what do our hobbies say about our culture? Steven Gelber here traces the history and significance of hobbies from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1950s. Although hobbies are often touted as a break from work, Gelber demonstrates that they reflect and reproduce the values and activities of the workplace by bringing utilitarian rationality into the home, imitating the economic stratification of the marketplace, and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Drawing on a wide array of social and cultural theory, Hobbies fills a critical gap in American cultural history and provides a compelling new perspective on the meaning of leisure.",

        "description": "This essay sheds light on the different types of hobbies that people can have, demystifies the best type of hobby for people to have, reveals the benefits of having hobbies, and delineates the problems with not having hobbies. Unbeknownst to most people, there are a myriad of disparate types of hobbies that people are at liberty to avail themselves of having if they so choose to do so. Since there are an exorbitant amount of different types of hobbies for people to pursue, people are not pigeonholed into pursuing a single type of hobby. The surfeit of different types of hobbies renders it possible for people to cherry-pick hobbies to pursue that are tailored to their preferences. The types of hobbies that are available for people to pursue extend far beyond the ambit of video game hobbies and trading card game hobbies. Some of the different types of hobbies that people can have encompass sports hobbies, creative hobbies, educational hobbies, outdoor hobbies, observational hobbies, video game hobbies, trading card game hobbies, board game hobbies, collecting hobbies, musical hobbies, and culinary hobbies. People often grossly underestimate the totality of hobbies that there are in existence. Due to there being a copious amount of disparate types of hobbies that people are at liberty to pursue, a person who has eclectic interests can, for instance, pursue a multitude of different types of hobbies that are able to assuage a myriad of his desires. Due to there being a cornucopia of disparate types of hobbies that people are at liberty to pursue, a person who, for instance, has succumbed to chronic boredom can remedy his chronic boredom with ease if he choose to pursue the hobbies that he is utmost passionate about pursuing. The prodigious selection of hobbies to choose from being pursuant of is so eminently vast that most people have not even dabbled into attempting to experience most of the different salubrious hobbies at least once in their lifetime as of June of 2022. Pursuing new hobbies allows you to avail yourself of experiencing new experiences. People should be amenable to dabbling into pursuing new hobbies in order to ascertain if doing so will induce a pleasurable dopamine-release sensation. People should be pursuant of salubrious hobbies and should never be pursuant of insalubrious hobbies. Pursuing hobbies not only provides you with stimuli, but also can provide you with an opportunity to befriend other people and expand your network if your attend social events that revolve around pursuing your hobbies alongside other people. You may, for instance, join a sports league which will furnish you the opportunity to partake in sports matches and meet people who are passionate about playing sports. You may, for instance, also join a gaming league which will furnish you the opportunity to partake in video game matches matches and meet people who are passionate about playing sports playing video games. Being around people who share the same hobbies as you cannot only allow you be able to befriend other people and expand your network if you attend social events that revolve around pursuing your hobbies alongside other people, but can also allow you to learn more insightful information about your shared hobbies if other people bequeath informative information to you that appertains to your hobbies. Being around people who share the same hobbies as you can also culminate in amplifying your fervent passion about your shared hobbies if it allows you to avail yourself of shared experiences with other people in which you pursue your hobbies alongside other people who can masterfully hype up your shared hobbies and elicit unalloyed excitement from you about your shared hobbles. People who hype up shared hobbies are able to do so by ardently gushing over how stimulating they are to experience first-hand. If you dabble into pursuing new hobbies and are disinterested in continuing to pursue them, then you should desist from further pursuing them in order to avert squandering your sacrosanct time. Pursuing hobbies that you are disinterested in continuing to further pursue is needless depletion of precious time, especially when you have the autonomy to pursue hobbies that that you are passionate about pursuing in lieu of pursuing hobbies that you are disinterested in continuing to further pursue.",

This ethnographic study explores how, why, and at what costs notions of relatedness, identity, and belonging are being renegotiated within local families and transnational kinship networks. Each entry point concerns the destructive\u2013productive constitution of family life, where neglected responsibilities, obligations, and trust lead not only to broken relationships, but also, and inevitably, to the innovative creation of new ones. By connecting the micro-politics of the migrant family with the macro-politics of the nation state and global conjunctures in general, the book argues that securitization and suspicion\u2014launched in the name of \u201cintegration\u201d\u2014escalate internal community dynamics and processes of family upheaval in unpredicted ways.",

        "description": "This edited book draws from work that focuses on the act of telling family stories, as well as their content and structure. The process of telling family stories is linked to central aspects of development, including language acquisition, affect regulation, and family interaction patterns. This book extends across traditional developmental psychology, personality theory, and family studies. Drawing broadly on the epigenetic framework for individual development articulated by Erik Erikson, as well as on conceptions of the family life cycle, the editors bring together contemporary examples of psychological research on family stories and their implications for development and change at different points in the life course. The book is divided into sections that focus on family stories at different points in the life cycle, from early childhood and the beginnings of narrative skill, through adolescence, young adulthood, midlife, and then mature adulthood and its intergenerational meaning. During each of these periods of the life cycle, research focusing on individual development within an Eriksonian framework of ego strengths and virtues is highlighted. The dynamic role of family stories is also featured here, with work exploring the links between family process, intergenerational attachment, and storytelling. Sociocultural theories that emphasize how such development is situated in the wider cultural context are also featured in several chapters. This broad lifespan developmental focus serves to integrate the exciting diversity of this work and foster further questions and research in the emerging field of family narrative. The book is intended primarily for researchers and advanced-level students in the fields of developmental and personality psychology, as well as those in family studies and in gerontology. It may also be of interest to those in the helping professions who are concerned with family therapy and family issues, and may--due to its content and illustrative material--have appeal to a wider market of the lay public. The chapters are written in a readily accessible style and the analyses are presented in a fairly non-technical way. Because family stories are charted across the lifespan, it would be a suitable companion book to a more traditional lifespan textbook in certain courses.",

While this has role of women as caregivers has been documented, the actual impact on the lives of women has remained largely unstudied. In this volume, the authors examine caregiving as a central feminist issue, looking at its impact on women socially, personally, and economically. The authors review how changing family structures, the changing economy and workforce, and the changing health care demands of needy adults have impacted on women\u2032s lives. They critique existing public and private policies, demonstrating a need for fundamental structural changes in social institutions and attitudes to improve the lives of women. Finally, they propose a social model of care that is oriented toward gender justice--recognition of the work of caring and its impact upon women socially, personally, and economically. For students, scholars and practitioners in the field of gerontology, gender studies, and social work, this book is a must.",

        "description": "Personal Relationships Across the Lifespan presents a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the role of personal relationships in people's lives. Highlighting areas of special significance and research interest at each major life-stage, Patricia Noller, Judith A. Feeney and Candida Peterson, examine how close relationships develop over time and influence individual adjustment. They explore a wide range of relationships, including some that are often neglected, such as those with siblings, adult children and elderly parents. They also look at alternative family forms, such as single-parent families and step-families, and address important themes such as intimacy, conflict and power. With insightful discussion of the theory and methods typically used by researchers working in this area, Personal Relationships Across the Lifespan is an ideal resource for students and researchers of both relationships and lifespan development. It will also be of interest to practitioners, such as social workers and family therapists, working with clients with relational concerns and anyone wanting to learn more about the nature of relationships.",

        "description": "Pocket Book edition of The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship by Massimilla and Bud Harris. Millions of books on relationships have been printed in the last several years. Why do we need another one? We need The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship for the same reasons that over four and a half million readers wanted Spencer Johnson's Who Moved My Cheese in a market that already had over 12,000 titles in print on the subject of change. Following Johnson's methods of teaching to a broad, modern audience, The Art of Love presents the profound principles that form a loving relationship in an easily accessible manner. Using a deceptively simple approach, it will help people shift their attitudes and give them the skills to create a loving, long-lasting partnership. There are so many titles in print on change because it is an ongoing challenge for most of us. So are relationships. With many years of experience working with couples, Bud and Massimilla Harris share vital information, lessons, and insights. Engaging, and easy to read, The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship is packed with wisdom, skills, and ideas that can open the door to a new era of fulfilling relationships. This forthcoming Fisher King Press publication brings complex material and common sense into a format that is carefully constructed to achieve results by being communicative and consistent, enjoyable and hopeful. Unlike the textbook appearance of many self-help books that include psychological jargon, case examples and exercises, The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship uses stories and dialogue to teach profound insights and valuable skills to handle problems in a way that builds love and trust. The Art of Love: The Craft of Relationship is for: * Singles and couples who seek self-improvement, who want to enrich their relationships, and who desire practical advice for helping love and trust grow. * Singles who are frustrated with their current relationships or have difficulty staying in long-term relationships, and who want to find and develop a more supportive and interactive partnership. * Couples who need to learn how to understand each other better in order to have their uniqueness affirmed without threatening their relationship. * Couples who are experiencing relational difficulties and who need to improve their communication with each other and learn how to handle conflicts in a way that brings them closer together. * Divorced individuals who need support in understanding why their marriages failed and who need encouragement in seeking to get their needs met again. * People who are interested in cultivating love and closeness in a way that supports individual growth. * Therapists and counselors who seek an accessible resource for their clients, and for readers who wish to explore the most recent perspectives on relationship dynamics. * Groups of people, whether religious or educational, who are concerned about the state of their relationships. People who are seeking to understand them and discover the promises of love and joy that being in life together can bring.",

Instead, it is for anyone looking to objectively assess their romantic relationship by asking the right questions at the right time. Key questions like, is my relationship healthy? Is it unhealthy? Is it where I want to be long-term, why or why not? Are my needs being met? Do I feel valued? The 4Cs decision-making framework has been lauded as sensible and relatable because it challenges individuals to evaluate their relationship through a different lens. One that begins with identifying their separate needs and then those of the all important third entity, the relationship. The 4Cs gives couples a common vocabulary and simple tools to use as they understand why things may or may not be working. The 4Cs of Relationships isn't about having another conversation on dating. This book forces people to have the RIGHT conversation about their relationships!",

But modern-day myths of attraction often have no basis in fact or \u2013 worse \u2013 are rooted in little more than misogyny. Based on science rather than self-help clich\u00e9s, psychologist Viren Swami debunks these myths and draws on cutting-edge research to provide a ground-breaking and evidence-based account of relationship formation. At the core of this book is a very simple idea: there are no \u2018laws of attraction\u2019, no fool-proof methods or strategies for getting someone to date you. But this isn\u2019t to say that there\u2019s nothing to be gained from studying attraction. Based on science rather than self-help clich\u00e9s, Attraction Explained looks at how factors such as geography, physical appearance, reciprocity, and similarity affect who we fall for and why. With updated statistics, this second edition also includes new content on online dating, queer relationships, racism in dating, shyness, and individual differences. It remains an engaging and accessible introduction to attraction relationship formation for professionals, students, and general readers.",

This book brings together perspectives from different disciplines on individual development and personal relationships across the life span. The book addresses two pertinent dimensions of personal relationships: 1) structures of relationship networks (e.g. kin vs non-kin, peripheral vs intimate, short-term vs long-term) and 2) processes (i.e. change or stability) and outcomes of personal relationships across the life span. The book stimulates discussion of personal relationships as resources for and outcomes of individual development throughout the life course. Different qualities of personal relationships serve as catalysts for individual development. At the same time, relationship qualities reflect changes of developing individuals. The book does not give exclusive priority to one phase of the human life span. Rather, each chapter addresses social development across the entire life span from childhood to later adulthood.",

        "description": "Have heterosexual relationships become more intimate and equal over the past forty years? Simply put, this is the central question underpinning this book. Within the context of late modern social processes, including most notably individualization and detraditionalization, authors such as Giddens, Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, and Bauman have come to focus on a posited transformation of personal relationships. This has culminated in a sociological debate over the nature of contemporary relationships, with proponents of change celebrating the emergence of an intimacy based on personal satisfaction rather than traditional obligations. Detractors reject this interpretation and instead lament what they consider to be the destruction of commitment and the demoralisation of personal relationships by the rise of individualism and consumerism. While these two entrenched positions have dominated the debate, a third, marginalised perspective has emerged, which questions the extent to which contemporary relationships have become detraditionalized, and emphasises evidence of continuing gender inequalities. This book is essentially a qualitative empirical investigation of the changes and continuities posited within the debate, which evaluates existing work and details the findings of van Hooff's research into the relationships of two generations of heterosexual couples. It provides the reader with a grounded interpretation of the evidence, questioning to what extent lived reality has matched the rhetoric within contemporary relationships.",

Conversely, this volume highlights the importance of considering external influences on individual decision-making in close relationships. Featuring contributions from internationally renowned scholars, the volume is divided into two interrelated sections. The first section considers global and societal influences on romantic relationships and the second section focuses on social network and communicative influences on romantic relationships. Taken together, this collection helps us to better understand how external factors influence the internal machinations of those involved in intimate relationships\"--",

        "description": "This is an honest book about effective foreign language learning methods in practice, unlike the many advertisements out there where the theories sound good, but you don't know how to apply them I have been living and working in Singapore for more than 10 years. I, like you, used to scratch my head because I didn't know how to learn English effectively. However during my high school years, I found the right method to self-learn English, and made remarkable improvements in a short amount of time. Then, during my second year in university, I became the sole recipient of the Singapore Government Scholarship in Northern Vietnam in 2013. I later applied the same method to self-learn Chinese, which proved to be even more effective. This motivated me to write this book, to share with you the methods that I have applied very successfully; with the hope that you will also be able to conquer the foreign language of your choice, and unlock lifechanging opportunities from there. I will share with you ALL the tips and tricks I have applied to conquering English and Chinese, there will be no holding back. So don't hesitate any longer, ACT NOW, and reap success sooner than you ever expected. \u0110\u00e2y l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t cu\u1ed1n s\u00e1ch r\u1ea5t ch\u00e2n th\u1eadt v\u1ec1 vi\u1ec7c h\u1ecdc ngo\u1ea1i ng\u1eef hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3 ngo\u00e0i th\u1ef1c t\u1ebf, d\u1ef1a tr\u00ean qu\u00e1 tr\u00ecnh t\u1ef1 h\u1ecdc c\u1ee7a ch\u00ednh b\u1ea3n th\u00e2n m\u00ecnh; kh\u00f4ng gi\u1ed1ng nh\u01b0 nh\u1eefng qu\u1ea3ng c\u00e1o ngo\u00e0i kia, l\u00fd thuy\u1ebft th\u00ec hay \u0111\u1ea5y nh\u01b0ng ch\u00fang ta kh\u00f4ng bi\u1ebft \u00e1p d\u1ee5ng nh\u01b0 th\u1ebf n\u00e0o.\u200b M\u00ecnh \u0111ang sinh s\u1ed1ng v\u00e0 l\u00e0m vi\u1ec7c t\u1ea1i Singapore \u0111\u00e3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c h\u01a1n 10 n\u0103m.

Henrik Larsen develops an analytical framework for analyzing these questions and offers solutions through an empirical examination of the foreign policy of a small EU member state in the context of EU foreign policy - the case of Denmark. The book looks at seven policy areas: policy towards other EU member states, anti-terrorism, development, the Balkans, Africa, Latin America and trade. On the basis of the empirical study, the implications for the theoretical study of national foreign policy in an EU Context are outlined. It is suggested that we need a new, mixed approach to foreign policy analysis within the EU taking into account the nature of the policy area concerned and national conceptions of actorness.",

The culmination of perhaps years of arbitration, enforcement of arbitral awards is a crucial element of arbitration and a subject best not taken lightly or left to the last minute. The Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards in Russia parses the judgments of Russian courts, with a particular focus on the decision-making processes of Russian judges as reflected in their judgments. The Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards in Russia addresses several questions, such as: \u2022 Which Russian courts enforce awards and what are they like? \u2022 What laws, treaties, and rules apply? \u2022 How do the courts reach their decisions? \u2022 Do those courts sometimes reach anomalous conclusions? \u2022 What should an applicant for enforcement watch out for? \u2022 What are the common pitfalls? With the help of Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards in Russia non-Russian readers will be able to ask intelligent questions, earlier rather than later, of the local counsel who will be making an application for enforcement in the Russian courts.",

        "description": "Despite the mounting criticism that globalization is encountering, the developed countries continue to lose no opportunity to change the rules of the global economy in their favour, regardless of the impact on developing countries and the poor. This book examines one of the most important instances of this: the rich countries' insistence that the WTO not only launch a new round of world trade negotiations, but that rules which were supposed to be confined to trade issues now be extended by means of new agreements protecting foreign direct investment. What is being proposed would be at the expense of the freedom of developing countries to determine their own policies towards foreign capital in tune with their development policy objectives. The two authors of this book have an intimate knowledge of WTO negotiating processes. They explain in detail the North's relentless determination to give privileged protection to the overseas investments of its transnational corporations. These initiatives have included, inter alia, the OECD's failed MAI initiative, the World Bank-sponsored Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and Agreement on Trade-related Investment Measures (TRIMS). The authors spell out their consequences for developing countries. They examine whether there is any real case for a new multilateral framework on investment within the WTO. And they propose various options for developing countries to resist what amounts to a new form of Western protectionism, including how a development dimension could be incorporated in any new agreement, should the member countries of the WTO decide to proceed with negotiations. This book provides invaluable information and analysis for diplomats and trade negotiators, policy makers and scholars, as well as civil society activists concerned with the impact of TNC investments on development.",

McLelland offers the first history of the social context of foreign language education in Britain, as well as an overview of changing approaches, methods and techniques in language teaching and learning. The important impact of classroom-external factors on developments in language teaching and learning is also taken into account, particularly regarding the policies and public examination requirements of the 20th century. Beginning with a chronological overview of language teaching and learning in Britain, McLelland explores which languages were learned when, why and by whom, before examining the social history of language teaching and learning in greater detail, addressing topics including the status that language learning and teaching have held in society. McLelland also provides a history of how languages have been taught, contrasting historical developments with current orthodoxies of language teaching. Experiences outside school are discussed with reference to examples from adult education, teach-yourself courses and military language learning. Providing an accessible, authoritative history of language education in Britain, Teaching and Learning Foreign Languages will appeal to academics and postgraduate students engaged in the history of education and language learning across the world. The book will also be of interest to teacher educators, trainee and practising teachers, policymakers and curriculum developers.",

He told the police that he needed the money to play online videogames. Just a month later, an eight-year-old Norwegian boy saved his younger sister's life by threatening an attacking moose and then feigning death when the moose attacked him--skills he said he learned while playing World of Warcraft. As these two instances show, videogames affect the minds, bodies, and lives of millions of gamers, negatively and positively. This book approaches videogame addiction from a cross-disciplinary perspective, bridging the divide between liberal arts academics and clinical researchers. The topic of addiction is examined neutrally, using accepted research in neuroscience, media studies, and developmental psychology.",

        "description": "This is a collection of recent novel contributions in game theory from a group of prominent authors in the field. It covers Non-cooperative Games, Equilibrium Analysis, Cooperative Games and Axiomatic Values in static and dynamic contexts.Part 1: Non-cooperative Games and Equilibrium AnalysisIn game theory, a non-cooperative game is a game with competition between individual players and in which only self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats) alliances (or competition between groups of players, called 'coalitions') are possible due to the absence of external means to enforce cooperative behavior (e.g. contract law), as opposed to cooperative games. In fact, non-cooperative games are the foundation for the development of cooperative games by acting as the status quo. Non-cooperative games are generally analysed through the framework of equilibrium, which tries to predict players' individual strategies and payoffs. Indeed, equilibrium analysis is the centre of non-cooperative games. This volume on non-cooperative games and equilibrium analysis contains a variety of non-cooperative games and non-cooperative game equilibria from prominent authors in the field.Part 2: Cooperative Games and Axiomatic ValuesIt is well known that non-cooperative behaviours, in general, would not lead to a Pareto optimal outcome. Highly undesirable outcomes (like the prisoner's dilemma) and even devastating results (like the tragedy of the commons) could appear when the involved parties only care about their individual interests in a non-cooperative situation. Cooperative games offer the possibility of obtaining socially optimal and group efficient solutions to decision problems involving strategic actions. In addition, axiomatic values serve as guidance for establishing cooperative solutions. This volume on cooperative games and axiomatic values presents a collection of cooperative games and axiomatic values from prominent authors in the field.",

        "description": "The right pricing strategy can change the entire trajectory of a business, a market, and even society at large. To help you create your best pricing strategy efficiently and confidently, two leaders from BCG are introducing fresh perspectives on pricing that take you far beyond the realm of mind-numbing numbers. In their new book Game Changer: How Strategic Pricing Shapes Businesses, Markets, and Society, Jean-Manuel Izaret and Arnab Sinha simplify and clarify pricing strategy by integrating its many frameworks and concepts into seven distinct pricing games, each with its own proven tools, rules, forces, and structures. To help you pick the right game and play it well, Izaret and Sinha have developed the Strategic Pricing Hexagon, a tool refined through years of testing, iteration, and adaptation. The Hexagon is your portal to a business world where stronger growth and better financial performance come from a set of strategic pricing decisions, not endless myopic quests for optimal prices. But more than that, the Hexagon will change the way you think about and talk about pricing. The current conversation around pricing \u2013 as expressed through economics textbooks, Excel spreadsheets, political discourse, and educated guesswork \u2013 makes it easy to believe that pricing is nothing more than a technical, tactical and, for most people, boring game of numbers. Game Changer changes that conversation bysharing stories and research that bring the Hexagon and its seven pricing games to life. With research from BCG\u2019s Bruce Henderson Institute and real-world examples from the world's most influential companies, the authors and their colleagues at BCG define pricing strategy as a business leader\u2019s or business owner\u2019s conscious decisions about how money flows in their market. They show how companies succeed in the long term when they focus on collaborative growth and value sharing with customers, not zero-sum value extraction from them.

        "description": "The technology of video games has progressed a great deal since the creation of the first video game systems. An example of an earlier video game would be Pong. In this game two players would control simple lines that could only go up or down on the screen. These lines were controlled by paddles and the point of the game was to hit the bouncing ball and make your opponent miss it. The video games of today are much more advanced than that. They offer multiple genres of games that are sure to meet the interests of almost any person. Most of them can also be played online which offers an entire new experience in itself. Some people may not take the profession of video game testing as a serious career. Video game testing is actually quite important in the development of a game, some would argue that they are just as important as the programmers. The main job of a game tester is to go through a game, level by level, scene by scene, and make sure that everything is working correctly and that the game is functioning up to par. You will need some knowledge in programming and you will need an eye that pays very close attention to detail. In most cases, the difference between a top seller and a game that does not do well at all is attention to detail. Let Us Know What You Think!",

Vertical gardening guarantees a better outcome from the day the trowel hits the soil\u2014by shrinking the amount of \"floor\" space needed and focusing on climbing plants that are less prone to insects, diseases, and animal pests. Notable author and gardener Derek Fell has tried and tested thousands of varieties of vegetables, flowers, and fruits and recommends the best plants for space-saving vertical gardening. His grow-up, grow-down system also shows which ground-level plants make good companions underneath and alongside climbing plants. Best of all, many of Fell's greatest climbers and mutually beneficial plants are available in seed packets in every local garden center. With a mix of DIY and commercially available string supports, trellises, pergolas, raised beds, skyscraper gardens, and topsy-turvy planters, the vertical garden system reduces work, increases yields, makes harvesting easier, and can be practiced in spaces as small as a container or a one-by-four-foot strip. Vertical Gardening features 100 color photos of the author's own vertical methods and showcases beautiful, troublefree perennials, shrubs, vegetables, annuals, and fruit perfect for this new, rewarding way to garden.",

Their first encounter with a women's studies textbook is likely to focus on the history and sociology of women's lives. While these topics are important, the emphasis on them has led to neglect of equally important issues. Transforming the Disciplines: A Women's Studies Primer is one of the first women's studies textbooks to show feminist scholarship as an active force, changing the way we study such diverse fields as architecture, bioethics, history, mathematics, religion, and sports studies. Although this text was designed as an introduction to women's studies, it is also rewarding for upper-level or graduate students who want to understand the pervasive effects of feminist theory. Most chapters provide a bibliography or list of further reading of significant works. Its clear, jargon-free prose makes feminist thought accessible to general readers without sacrificing the revolutionary power of its ideas. In almost thirty essays, covering a broad range of subjects from anthropology to chemistry to rhetoric, Transforming the Disciplines exemplifies the changes achieved by feminist thought. Transforming the Disciplines: combines a high standard of writing and scholarship with personal insight includes both traditional academic arguments and alternative, non-agonistic forms of discussion embraces an international scope challenges traditional assumptions, models, and methodologies offers an inter- and multidisciplinary approach strengthens readers\u2019understanding of the big picture not only for women but for all disempowered groups critiques feminism as well as patriarchal society Feminist theory is grounded in a questioning of traditional assumptions about what is right, natural, and self-evident, not just about the roles and nature of men and women but about how we think, what we teach, whose experience matters, and what is important. Transforming the Disciplines is the first textbook to show the consequences of those questions -- not the answers themselves, but the consequences of the willingness to ask and the transformations that have occurred when the \u201cright\u201d answers changed.",

        "description": "In this vital new study, Andrew Abbott presents a fresh and daring analysis of the evolution and development of the social sciences. Chaos of Disciplines reconsiders how knowledge actually changes and advances. Challenging the accepted belief that social sciences are in a perpetual state of progress, Abbott contends that disciplines instead cycle around an inevitable pattern of core principles. New schools of thought, then, are less a reaction to an established order than they are a reinvention of fundamental concepts. Chaos of Disciplines uses fractals to explain the patterns of disciplines, and then applies them to key debates that surround the social sciences. Abbott argues that knowledge in different disciplines is organized by common oppositions that function at any level of theoretical or methodological scale. Opposing perspectives of thought and method, then, in fields ranging from history, sociology, and literature, are to the contrary, radically similar; much like fractals, they are each mutual reflections of their own distinctions.",

Based on sustained research into students\u2019 experiences in an ESP context in Hong Kong, this volume provides an empirically grounded and practical methodology to ESP learning and course design and features: \u2022 mixed-method case studies; \u2022 links between theory and practice, with plentiful examples of teaching materials and learning activities; \u2022 recognition of the effect of new technologies and globalization on the practice of ESP, highlighting problems and providing practical solutions; \u2022 a new pedagogical model for ESP course design, addressing multiple dimensions relevant to today\u2019s ESP learners including learner autonomy, genre, multimodality and digital literacies, plurilingual practices, and project-based learning and collaboration. English in the Disciplines provides key reading for anyone studying and researching this topic.",

They present the intellectual biographies of their explorations, the insights they have gained and examples of the practices they have adopted.The authors all demonstrate how the ways of thinking they have identified as significant for their students in their respective disciplines have affected the way they design learning experiences and assessments. They show how they have shaped their teaching around the ways of thinking they want their students to develop within and across their disciplines; and what that means in terms of designing assessments that require students to demonstrate their thinking and understanding through application and use. This book will appeal to faculty interested in going beyond mere techniques to a more substantive analysis of how their view of their respective disciplines might change when seen through the lens of student learning. It will also serve the needs of graduate students; trainers of Tas; and anyone engaged in faculty development or interested in the scholarship of teaching.",

        "description": "Military chaplains are highly trained professionals with multiple graduate degrees and varying civilian pastoral experience. They enter the chaplaincy after a rigorous selection process and military courses, which all must verify their calling to military ministry. Throughout a chaplain\u2019s career, he or she will attend many continuing education seminars, civilian education graduate programs, and conferences, all provided by the military. However, chaplains are challenged with the rigorous multitasked environment of this ministry. Multiple deployments into combat have negatively impacted the personal lives of those seeking to care for the souls of the soldier. This book encourages the importance of spiritual resiliency in the lives of leaders, both military and civilian. Leaders who regularly practice spiritual disciplines will be less likely to suffer personal and professional failure, or burnout. Second, the leader\u2019s practice of spiritual disciplines is essential to fostering positive modeling and mentoring for young chaplains and those wishing to serve. Third, practicing historic Christian spiritual disciplines will benefit those who strive to lead congregations and especially military installations in the free exercise of their faith.",

Beautiful, reflective, and at times humorous, Nabhan\u2019s extended essay also called \u201cThe Nature of Desert Nature\u201d reveals the complexity of what a desert is and can be. He passionately writes about what it is like to visit a desert and what living in a desert looks like when viewed through a new frame, turning age-old notions of the desert on their heads. Nabhan invites a prism of voices\u2014friends, colleagues, and advisors from his more than four decades of study of deserts\u2014to bring their own perspectives. Scientists, artists, desert contemplatives, poets, and writers bring the desert into view and investigate why these places compel us to walk through their sands and beneath their cacti and acacia. We observe the spines and spears, stings and songs of the desert anew. Unexpected. Surprising. Enchanting. Like the desert itself, each essay offers renewed vocabulary and thoughtful perceptions. The desert inspires wonder. Attending to history, culture, science, and spirit, The Nature of Desert Nature celebrates the bounty and the significance of desert places. Contributors Thomas M.

        "description": "\u201cWhere can pet parents go to find a compilation of information that will help them support their pets\u2019 various physical, emotional and spiritual needs?\u201d A frequently asked question in my practice\u2014Dr. Monica There usually comes a time toward the end of our pets\u2019 lives when we need to let go and let nature take its course. But in the face of most of the distresses and health challenges our pets encounter in daily living, we don\u2019t need to stand by crying helplessly and feeling sad. We can\u2014Do Something! Yet, where can pet parents go to find a compilation of information, which will help them support their pets\u2019 various physical, emotional and spiritual needs? As I finished writing my second book, Pets Have Feelings Too!, it was this very question that impelled me to begin yet another book\u2014one that would be a \u201chow to\u201d guide for everyone who wants to do everything they can to help their pets, especially when their pets are in distress or experiencing health challenges of any kind. It all began with my desire to respond to the question, asked by so many of my clients and students over the years, \u201cHow can I talk with my pets?\u201d But there were so many other topics which sprang to mind as I continued to write that before I knew it, I had enough material for a series of three \u201chow to\u201d books: \u2022 How To Communicate With Your Pets and Help Them Heal; \u2022 How To Heal Your Pets Using Nutrition, Herbs and Supplements; and \u2022 How To Heal Your Pets Using Alternative Therapies This, the first book in the series, begins by teaching you how to communicate with your pets about everyday things, as well as their health challenges. But discovering what your pets want to tell you is only the beginning. Once you\u2019re truly aware of their needs, you must then Do Something! That \u201csomething\u201d usually involves restoring balance and harmony in their lives. So, the second part of the first book shows you how to use spiritual and energetic healing methods as one way to bring about that balance and harmony. There are also a series of guided meditations to enable you to help your pet cope with a variety of life situations. The second book of the series covers the importance of nutrition, herbs and supplements, plus foods to avoid, and recipes for pets with special needs. The third book presents practical healing modalities including homeopathy, flower essences, incense, essential oils, crystals, color, sound, massage, magnets, hydrotherapy, acupressure, acupuncture and chiropractic, plus some other helpful guidance. As I was writing all three books, I knew many readers would wonder what qualifies me to teach people how to communicate with and heal their animals. What experiences and training did I have that prepared me not only to do this, but also to teach others to do the same? To answer this question, I\u2019d like to share a few of the highlights of my life with you. I\u2019ve known that I can understand what animals are saying ever since I was eight years old. However, when I was young, other children used to call me weird or crazy, and that was very painful. I didn\u2019t want to be different, so I tried hard to push aside the images animals were sending me and make believe I wasn\u2019t receiving them. But by my late teens, I began to realize that what I was experiencing was a gift\u2014one that was becoming virtually impossible to ignore. So I nurtured this gift, and soon I grew more confident about using my abilities. I began communicating with many different species of pets and was delighted to be able to help them and their humans better understand each other. In time, I realized that I\u2019d taken the first step on the path of what I considered to be my Life Assignment. But I\u2019d also been searching for answers to many spiritual questions for the better part of my life. The answers to those questions came one at a time over several years. I read a lot of books and attended many classes. One of those classes, offered by a Vietnamese gentleman, Master Tam Nguyen, would change the direction of the rest of my life and teach me how to use my intuitive gift more fully. From him, I learned that healing is about restoring balance and harmony, that healing is available to everyone, and that we can bring about healing for ourselves and for others. During the last week of Master Tam\u2019s class, he was able to help me experience the Life Force Energy that always surrounds every living being. This loving, healing Light and Energy surrounded me in a way I\u2019d never felt it before. When the class exercise was over, I was crying. For the first time in my life, I\u2019d been able to feel this energy. It came charged with such Love that I felt God had just embraced me. Master Tam approached me after class and encouraged me to continue to learn to let this loving, healing Energy flow through me for the benefit of others. He also invited me to come to his Center. I think I went the first time because I was curious, but I kept going back because I was learning so much about helping others to heal, not only spiritually, but also physically. I was drawn to return again and again. Observing many healing experiences filled me with the desire to further deepen my knowledge and understanding of metaphysics, and it was this study that would gently lead me along the path of unconditional love. And what better way to express unconditional Love for someone than by bringing balance and harmony into their lives through healing. Through Master Tam\u2019s teachings, I\u2019d already been introduced to the technique of Cosmic Healing, which helps every living being function, as it should in perfect harmony with the Universe. Cosmic Healing doesn\u2019t use any physical modalities like touch or medicine. Instead, it\u2019s done spiritually, from the heart, and with love. This type of healing requires direct communion with the Source of All Life, God, Spirit, Life Force, Supreme Being, All That Is. In the process of learning to tune in to this loving, healing Energy, the skeptic in me reacted by asking, \u201cIf healing energy always surrounds everyone all the time, why isn\u2019t everyone accessing it more often? And why do we see so much sickness around us? What, if anything, can we do to bring healing to others, or to help people find healing for themselves?\u201d With patience and further experience, I began to understand that often, people in need of healing haven\u2019t learned to ask for help, or they feel they don\u2019t deserve it. Most of them know they want to be healed but they don\u2019t ask to be healed. They may not even know how to ask. So what should we do to find effective healing? First, we need to believe that healing is possible, that it does take place, and that we can heal ourselves. We also need to have confidence that the healing energy of The Universe can flow through us, or flow to us through others. Above all, the person needing healing, and the person helping, must take time to be in communion, or attunement, with the one true Source of All Life. Then we must stop looking at the problem itself and start focusing on our connectedness to, and our oneness with, the Source of our Being, the Source of our balance and harmony. When we once again fully remember our oneness with Spirit, we\u2019re then able to manifest abundant good health for ourselves and for others. For a number of years, I helped many people heal, and I communicated with many pets about everyday things, but I\u2019d never thought about combining my gift for healing with my gift for communicating with animals. It was one of my own precious Shih- Tzus who would show me the way. Chop Chop was only two years old when, one day, he was lying beside me with his eyes fixed somewhere on the horizon. He was giving up, and death seemed to be looming not many hours away from him. Unable to think clearly, all I could do was to keep him company, crying because there didn\u2019t seem to be anything else I could do to help him. Two different veterinarians had already closely examined him. Medications were no longer effective, and the prognosis was very bleak. I lay on blankets on the floor next to him to give him what comfort I could. But as I reclined there beside him on the floor, feeling very sad and miserable, he sent me a telepathic message just as clear as day: \u201cYou call yourself a healer. You\u2019ve helped a lot of people. So Do Something!\u201d He now looked me straight in the eye as he prompted me to be an active participant, not just a sorrowful bystander. What he said to me kept playing over and over again in my mind until I finally got it. His plea was very simple, yet I hadn\u2019t thought to use spiritual healing for him, or for other animals for that matter. I\u2019d only used it to help people. But that was about to change. He responded, literally overnight, to the first healing treatment I gave him, and within a week of continued treatments, he was completely back to being his normal happy self. You can read the full account of his story in Chapter 1 of my first book, What Your Animals Tell Me. Thanks to the lesson Chop Chop taught me, I knew, then, that it was time to combine my gift for healing spiritually with my gift for communicating with animals. There were many other intuitives available to help heal people, so from then on, I resolved to dedicate my life exclusively to helping only animals. My work now includes not only private consultations for pets, but also presenting classes, workshops and lectures, as well as doing extensive research, and writing books to share with others all that I\u2019ve learned about how we can make life better for our beloved pets. During the early part of my experience with Chop Chop, I could only cry, feel sorry for myself and for him, and wait for the inevitable. I felt completely inadequate, totally devoid of ideas, and utterly helpless. Later on, it occurred to me that many pet parents often feel just as I did whenever they\u2019re faced with their pets\u2019 illnesses. But you don\u2019t need to go through those same feelings because there are so many things you can do, either to help your pets heal, or at least go through the process of their illness or pain with less discomfort. To help you, I\u2019ve described as many healing modalities as possible in the three books of this series, For Pet\u2019s Sake, Do Something! If you\u2019re able to ease your pet\u2019s pain, or provide quality of life for another day, week, month or even longer by implementing any of the healing techniques described in these books, your time and money spent on them will have been well worth it. My teacher and beloved animal friend, Chop Chop, taught me that I didn\u2019t have to be a bystander. Thanks to him, when I was on the verge of giving up, I discovered instead that I could Do Something! I hope you\u2019ll Do Something too. Healing can be brought about in many ways, not only for your pets, but also for yourself. When you\u2019re able to be an active participant in your pet\u2019s care, or bring peace and comfort to your pet because you\u2019ve been able to Do Something, your spirit will also be healed.

        "description": "Michael Brein\u2019s Travel Tales Monthly is a monthly bookazine release of simply incredible travel tales, told 10 at a time. Michael Brein, aka The Travel Psychologist has made it his life\u2019s passion to interview, now more than 1,750 world adventurers and travelers he has met throughout his world travels to more than 125 countries over the last four decades. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the incredible stories people have told me about their travels,\u201d says Michael when he talks about the nearly 10,000 travel tales he has amassed over the years in this way. Stories run the gamut of the good, the wonderful, and the magical, as well as, indeed, the bad, the horrible, and the truly horrific! These are--simply stated--great stories! Stories are told mainly in the present tense by interviewees, but, sadly, some are revealed about travelers who unfortunately did not live to tell their tales. These have often been related by weary, bleary-eyed travelers who felt that these tales should also be told. Into the pages of Travel Tales Monthly and then into the volumes of The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series ebooks will go the formerly untold tales of close calls, dangers, and great escapes; the mystical, spiritual, and the paranormal; meeting people, making friends, and incredible hospitality; harassment by beggars, hustlers, and con artists of all kinds; formidable characters met and phenomenal experiences had; and much, much more\u2014all in the form of about 200 ebooks covering all sorts of subjects, countries and themes. The intent of Travel Tales Monthly is to present collections of tales each month, introducing you to the stories as they make their way into The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series in the form of completed standalone ebooks in the series. The telling of travel stories by Michael Brein via his Travel Tales Monthly as well as his travel tales ebook series is travel storytelling par excellence, but with one significant difference: Michael Brein is the world\u2019s first and perhaps only travel psychologist. Thus, he tells the travel stories with a particular, unique psychological bent\u2014there\u2019s a lot of travel psychology behind everyone\u2019s sharing of their experiences. With deft and persistence, Michael hones in on and ferrets out the usually heretofore unexplored and untold truly psychological netherworld that lurks just below the surface of most people\u2019s travel experiences, bringing them into full view. For instance, what led up to a good or wonderful travel experience? How can we experience more of same? What was behind the horrific life-threatening or pickpocketing experience that got you caught up in in that one horrendous moment? Let\u2019s unravel bad experiences piece by piece to see how this might have been avoided in the first place. Let\u2019s unfold wonderful travel experiences to see how these may be repeated. What are some of the philosophical and life-changing insights gained from mystical experiences in one\u2019s travels? What\u2019s it like to experience your roots? How does it feel to be the first white person that others have ever seen? How does it feel like to be touched by a stranger? What is real fear like? On and on, Michael Brein delves into travel experiences from the standpoint of what is interesting, what is to be learned, and what is to be gained? How can this be made to happen again? Or NOT at all? Michael Brein is sure that you will be mesmerized and captivated by the stories you read in his Travel Tales Monthly and in his Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series. In this Issue (No. 4 Oct 2014): Michael Brein\u2019s Travel Tales Monthly Bookazine Issue No. 4 for October 2014 contains among the best travel stories from Michael\u2019s huge collection of about 10,000 travel tales that he has gathered in interviews with nearly 1,750 world travelers and adventurers during his four decades of travel to more than 125 countries throughout the world. The 10 travel tales that are featured for October, as well as each following month, include a fascinating mix of travel stories as well as a few brief vignettes. The October issue features such tales as The Hug, Les Ugly Americains, and The Red Dodge, whereby travelers get themselves into trouble by behaving and acting in ways that make them \u2018Persona Non-Grata\u2019 overseas. It is difficult enough to be culturally sensitive back home. But what are the consequences of being insensitive in a strange foreign land? What do you do? And, if that is not enough for you, how about Run! Run!, our featured story for this month about an \u2019ugly\u2019 American, who, in spite of himself, commits a series of simple cultural faux pas in Kathmandu\u2014contrary to the good advice of a friend\u2014a \u2018beautiful\u2019 American this time\u2014which gets out of hand and morphs into a very scary, close call involving his worst nightmare and a possible threat to his life. You are going to consider this month what goes into being the \u2018Good, Bad, and the Ugly\u2019 of travel. And you will also see some aspects of travel that you may not ever have considered before. And, once again, you will certainly experience vicariously those odd vagaries of travel-life that can await you and can suddenly appear just around the corner at about any turn along the way. Dr. Loren Ekroth, our guest contributor for this month, revisits us with some very good travel advice and \u2018picks.\u2019",

        "description": "Travel, Tourism and Identity addresses the psychological and social adjustments that occur when people make contact with others outside their social, cultural, or linguistic groups. Whether such contact is the result of tourism, seeking exile, or relocating abroad, the volume's contributors demonstrate how one's identity, cultural assumptions, and worldview can be brought into question. In some cases, the traveller finds that bridging the social and cultural gap between himself and the new society is fairly easy. In other cases, the traveller discovers that reorienting himself requires absorbing a new cultural history and traditions. The contributors argue that making these adjustments will surely enhance the traveller's or tourist's experience; otherwise the traveller or tourist will be at risk of becoming a marginalized figure, one disconnected from the society that surrounds him. This latest volume in the Culture & Civilization series features a collection of essays on travel and tourism. The essays cover a range of topics from historical travels to modern social identities. They discuss ancient travels, contemporary travels in Europe, Africa and sustainable eco-tourism, and the politics of tourism. Essays also address experiences of Grenada's \"Spice Island\" identity, and the effects of globalization and migrations on personal identity.",

Over the past decade, rapid development of ICT has led to extensive social impacts and influence on travel and mobility patterns within urban spaces. A new field of research of digital social networks and travel behaviour is now emerging. This book presents state-of-the-art knowledge, cutting-edge research and integrated analysis methods from the fields of social networks, travel behaviour and urban analysis. It explores the challenges related to the question of how we can synchronize among social networks activities, transport means, intelligent communication/information technologies and the urban form. This innovative book encourages multidisciplinary insights and fusion among three disciplines of social networks, travel behaviour and urban analysis. It offers new horizons for research and will be of interest to students and scholars studying mobilities, transport studies, urban geography, urban planning, the built environment and urban policy.",

        "description": "In recent years numerous films, television series, comic books, graphic novels and video games have featured time travel narratives, with characters jumping backward, forward and laterally through time. No rules govern time travel in these stories. Some characters move by machine, some by magic, others by unexplained means. Sometime travelers can alter the timeline, while others are prevented from causing temporal aberrations. The fluid forms of imagined time travel have fascinated audiences and prompted debate since at least the 19th century. What is behind our fascination with time travel? What does it mean to be out of one's own era? How do different media tell these stories and what does this reveal about the media's relationship to time? This collection of new essays--the first to address time travel across a range of media--answers these questions by locating time travel narratives within their cultural, historical and philosophical contexts. Texts discussed include Doctor Who, The Terminator, The Georgian House, Save the Date, Back to the Future, Inception, Source Code and others.",

        "description": "Travel and tourism have a long association with the notion of transformation, both in terms of self and social collectives. What is surprising, however, is that this association has, on the whole, remained relatively underexplored and unchallenged, with little in the way of a corpus of academic literature surrounding these themes. Instead, much of the literature to date has focused upon describing and categorising tourism and travel experiences from a supply-side perspective, with travellers themselves defined in terms of their motivations and interests. While the tourism field can lay claim to several significant milestone contributions, there have been few recent attempts at a rigorous re-theorization of the issues arising from the travel/transformation nexus. The opportunity to explore the socio-cultural dimensions of transformation through travel has thus far been missed. Bringing together geographers, sociologists, cultural researchers, philosophers, anthropologists, visual researchers, literary scholars and heritage researchers, this volume explores what it means to transform through travel in a modern, mobile world. In doing so, it draws upon a wide variety of traveller perspectives - including tourists, backpackers, lifestyle travellers, migrants, refugees, nomads, walkers, writers, poets, virtual travellers and cosmetic surgery patients - to unpack a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination since the very first works of Western literature.",

        "description": "This innovative volume focuses on tourism through the twin lenses of cultural theory and cultural geography. Presenting a set of innovative case studies on tourist destinations around the world, the contributors explore the paradoxes of the tourist experience and the implications of these paradoxes for our broader understanding of the problems of modernity and identity. The book examines how tourism reveals the paradoxical ways that places are both mobile and rooted, real and fake, inhabited by those who are simultaneously insiders and outsiders, and both subjectively experienced and objectively viewed. The concepts of travel and mobility long have been used to explain modern identity and social behavior, but this work pushes beyond the established literature by considering the ways that place and mobility are inherently related in unexpected, even contradictory ways. Travel, the international cast of authors contends, occurs 'in place' rather than 'between places.' Thus, instead of offering yet another interpretation of the ways modern societies are distinguished by their mobilities-in contrast to the supposed place-bound quality of traditional societies-the chapters here collectively argue for an understanding of modern identity as simultaneously grounded and mobile. This rich blend of empirical and theoretical analysis will be invaluable for cultural geographers, anthropologists, and sociologists of tourism.",

Building on principles of adult learning, the authors provide examples of academic excellence achieved through the incorporation of best practices in adult education, including: practical suggestions for democratically negotiating the curriculum, best practices for nurturing responsible action for social justice, ways of encouraging collaborative and noncompetitive learning and research, and support in shifting paradigmatic assumptions beyond the Eurocentric frame. This is the 147th volume of the Jossey Bass series New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education. Noted for its depth of coverage, it explores issues of common interest to instructors, administrators, counselors, and policymakers in a broad range of education settings, such as colleges and universities, extension programs, businesses, libraries, and museums.",

        "description": "Aid to developing countries started well before World War II, but was undertaken as an ad hoc activity or was delivered by private organizations. This changed after the War. In his Inaugural Address in 1949, the American President, Harry Truman, announced a \u201cbold new programme for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped nations\u201d (the so-called \u201cPoint IV\u201d Plan). At that time it was thought that this support would be needed only for a limited number of years, comparable to the Marshall Plan assistance to Europe. But reality proved to be different: providing aid was a very long-term affair. Since the Fifties, the aid provided has changed at different occasions. In the beginning, aid concentrated on constructing infrastructure, such as roads, railways, dams, and harbours, in order to promote industrial development. In the Sixties, aid to agriculture was added, and in the Seventies aid to social sectors (Basic Needs) was also provided. The Eighties brought worldwide debt problems. Major donors applied structural adjustment policies; some called this the lost decade (d\u00e9cada perdida). The Nineties saw the arrival of the first environmental considerations, and asked for attention for the role of women and good governance. The form of aid changed from projects to programmes and budget support. Describing the different aid forms of the last 65 years and analysing why aid changed from time to time are the subjects of this book. Professionals and students in the area of international cooperation will benefit from studying this history, as, at this moment, old concepts are reappearing or applied by new donors like China. Is the pendulum really swinging back, as Louis Emmerij at one point suggested?",

        "description": "At the global level, international actors have repeatedly expressed their desire to end hunger and food insecurity. However, food insecurity has persisted. More analysis is hence needed on the link between continuously high levels of global food insecurity and the ever increasing flow of development aid. Global Food Security and Development Aid investigates the impact that development aid has had on food security in developing countries and includes international case studies on Peru, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam. It examines the effect of development aid in general and the impact of aid divided into different categories based on donor, mechanism and sector to which it is provided. In each examined relationship between aid and food security, particular attention is paid to the potentially intervening role played by the quality of national and/or local governance. The book makes policy recommendations, most importantly that donors should take greater care in considering which types of aid are suitable to which specific countries, localities, and development goals, and account for expected developments in the complex relationship between aid, food security, and governance. This book will be of considerable interest to students, researchers and policy-makers in the areas of development aid and food security.",

        "description": "Several development proponents, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and policymakers are pressing the 111th Congress to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities to better address 21st Century development needs and national security challenges. Over the past nearly 50 years, the legislative foundation for U.S. foreign aid has evolved largely by amending the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195), the primary statutory basis for U.S. foreign aid programs, or enacting separate freestanding laws to reflect specific U.S. foreign policy interests. Many describe U.S. aid programs as fragmented, cumbersome, and not finely tuned to address the existing needs and U.S. national security interests. Lack of a comprehensive congressional reauthorization of foreign aid for about half of those fifty years further compounds the perceived weakness of U.S. aid programs and statutes. The current structure of U.S. foreign aid entities, as well as implementation and follow-up monitoring of the effectiveness of aid programs, have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Criticisms include a lack of focus and coherence overall, too many agencies involved in delivering aid with inadequate coordination or leadership, lack of flexibility, responsiveness and transparency of aid programs, and a perceived lack of progress in some countries that have been aid recipients for decades. Over the last decade, a number of observers have expressed a growing concern about the increasing involvement of the Department of Defense in foreign aid activities.",

        "description": "Note: this is an abridged version of the book with references removed. The complete edition is also available on this website. This book offers a comprehensive, detailed account of the bilateral economic assistance of six major donor nations-the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Japan, and China-to the nations of Latin America. Focus is placed on assistance that is structured to meet basic human needs, enhance social equity, promote economic growth, preserve natural environments, and support political reform. It thus offers a basic foundation for understanding the nature, impact, and motivations of such assistance to Latin America. This study also offers a series of recommendations for reforming economic assistance to Latin America, with emphasis placed on improving the design, implementation, and oversight of development projects, enhancing coordination among aid institutions, ensuring local control and ownership of the development process, and empowering poor communities. When the poor are active participants in improving their communities, they gain the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to meet their own needs on a long-term basis. Since economic assistance will continue to be a major component of the foreign policies of donor states, it will be important to ensure that such assistance genuinely contributes to positive, meaningful, and lasting change in the region. Bilateral Aid to Latin America is an important volume for university libraries and research institutes. It will augment collections that focus on Latin America, international development, and economic assistance. The book would also be relevant for scholars and practitioners of Latin American development, as well as undergraduate and graduate courses on Latin America and international political economy.",

Most young writers are not intimidated by personal narrative, fiction, or even poetry, but when they try to put together a \"teaching book,\" report, or persuasive essay, they often feel anxious and frustrated. JoAnn Portalupi and Ralph Fletcher believe that young nonfiction writers supply plenty of passion, keen interest, and wonder. Teachers can provide concrete strategies to help students scaffold their ideas as they write in his challenging genre. Like the authors' best-selling Craft Lessons: Teaching Writing K-8, this book is divided into sections for K-2, 3-4, and middle school (grades 5-8) students. These divisions reflect various differences between emerging, competent, and fluent writers. In each section you'll find a generous collection of craft lessons directed at the genre that's most appropriate for that particular age. In the K-2 section, for example, a number of craft lessons focus on the all-about or concept book. In the 3-4 section there are several lessons on biography. In the 5-8 section a series of lessons addresses expository writing. Throughout the book each of the 80 lessons is presented on a single page in an easy-to-read format. Every lesson features three teaching guidelines: Discussion--A brief look at the reasons for teaching the particular element of craft specifically in a nonfiction context.How to Teach It--Concrete language showing exactly how a teacher might bring this craft element to students in writing conferences or a small-group setting.Resource Material--Specific book or text referred to in the craft lesson including trade books, or a piece of student writing in the Appendixes. This book will help students breathe voice into lifeless \"dump-truck\" writing and improve their nonfiction writing by making it clearer, more authoritative, and more organized. Nonfiction Craft Lessons gives teachers a wealth of practical strategies to help students grow into strong writers as they explore and explain the world around them. Be sure to look at the When Students Write videotapes too.",

This book is organized to help plan lessons using each type of nonfiction structure. Strategies and suggestions for activities to use before, during and after reading are included. Templates and graphic organizers are also provided in order to facilitate planning, and offer additional resources. Detailed information about each text structure as well as mentor texts to illustrate each type is included. Text structures, as well as text access features, are defined and located in easy reference charts. Whole class and small group planning ideas are included throughout the book in order to allow for differentiation. Additionally, assessment ideas, sample think-alouds, lesson planning templates, and sample lessons with completed graphic organizers are included for each text structure.",

        "description": "Writers are increasingly using ChatGPT, an advanced natural language processing model developed by OpenAI, to help with various aspects of their writing process. ChatGPT uses machine learning to generate human-like responses to text prompts, making it a valuable tool for generating ideas, overcoming writer's block, and even providing inspiration for full-length works. In this chapter, we will explore some of the ways in which writers are using ChatGPT and the benefits and limitations of this technology. One of the most popular uses of ChatGPT for writers is to generate ideas. By providing a text prompt, such as a sentence or a few words, ChatGPT can generate a list of potential ideas or prompts for further exploration. This can be especially useful for writers who are stuck or experiencing writer's block and need a new angle or direction to pursue. ChatGPT can also be used to develop characters by generating personality traits, backgrounds, and motivations. By providing a basic description of a character, ChatGPT can generate a list of potential traits and characteristics that can be further developed and explored. This can be especially useful for writers who are struggling to develop complex, multi-dimensional characters. Another way that writers are using ChatGPT is to explore different plot points or scenarios.",
